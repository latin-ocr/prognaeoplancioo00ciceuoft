1. 32. Ι.. Racssfi] Lucius Racilius was a warni supportet of
Cicero. He was tribune of the plebs in B-C. 561A.U.C. 697, with Cn.
Plancius as his colleague. He took part in the disorders which arose
when Clodius, accused by Milo de vi, sought to get rid of the charge by
becoming a candidate sor the aedileship. The question was debated in
the senate. and in the forum sought to be decided by open soree} whether
the trial should come on first or the election of aediles, or vice versa.
Milo had now retired into private life: the consuls were gone to their
provinces; P. Rutilius Lupus a tribune os the pcople, summoned a
meeting of the senate: only about 200 members attended. Racilius
renewed the debate about Milo’s impeachment of Clodius, and called
upon Lentulus Marcellinus the consul designate to give his opinion
upon it: who proposed that in the first place an allotmcnt of judices
should be made sor the trial and after that the election of aediles, and
that if any one attempted to hinder the trial, he should be deemed a
public enemy. The tribunes C. Cato and C. Cassius spoke against it,
aud were sor proceeding to an electiori before any step towards a trial.
L. Philippus, the other consul elect, was of the same mind as his col-
league, and Cic. being· called upon to speak (lenounced Clodius; he
was followed by others. Clodius began to speak with the intention of
wasting the rest of the day (diem dicendo eximere coqu'tffi the rabble of
his followers outside expressed their opinions so loudly, that the senate
broke up in a hurry. In the civil war Racilius espoused Caesar¹s
party and was with his army in Spain in 13.C. 48. There he entered
into the conspiracy soi-med against the lise of Q. Cassius Longinus. the
governor of that province, by whom he was put to death with the rest
os the conspirators. Smith Dict. Bag-r. vol. ιιι p. 040.
