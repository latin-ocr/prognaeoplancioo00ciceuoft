“Dr Holden truly states that ‘'l'cxt, Ananvsis, and Commentary in this third “

edition have been again subjected to a thorough revision) It is now certainly the
best edition extant. Asufficient apparatus os various readings is placed under the
text. and a very caresul summary in the margin. The Introduction (after Heine)
and notes leave nothing to lie desired in point os sulness‚ accuracy, and neatness; the
typographical execution will satissy the most fastidiens eye. A caresul index of
twenty-four pages makes it easy to use the book as a storehouse of information on
points of grammar, history, and philosophy. . . . This edition of the Offices, Mr

⁷ Reid’s Academics, LaeliuS‚ and Cato, with the forthcoming editions of the De

Finibus and the De Natura Deorum will do much to maintain the study os Cicero’s
philosophy in Roget Aseham's universuy.'¹-N0tes and Queries.
