being made indicates a certain relation between crimina am-
bitus and sodaliciorum, though their diversity appears from
this oration no less than from the fact that the tribunals sor
trying the two offences were distinct, that the same person
could be tried for each separatelyffi, and lastly that, whereas
unsuccessful candidates could be punished for ambz'tusssss, for
sodalt'cz'a only those actually elected were punishable.

of sodalicia and what its affinity with and distinction from
ordinary ambitus.

The right of combination in common pursuance of common
aims was not restricted in Roman law. There was no enact-
ment abolishing this right in a general way, for the laws
usually cited to prove the contrary apply to nightly assemblages
and gatherings, to popular meetings not presided over by a
magistrate, or to specially-named unions, as the law against
the Bacchanalia: indeed the xii tahles contained, according to
Gaius⁷ a clause permitting asseniblages in cases where no
existing dccree was infringed by them. Thus arose the sodalt-
tates, the collegia and the sodalicia, for whose members the
general term sodales was in use, although the obJects of the
several associations were essentially different.
