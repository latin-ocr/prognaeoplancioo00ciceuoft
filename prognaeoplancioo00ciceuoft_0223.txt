pugnatum, quo magis repulsam ferret. Existimamus igitur eum legem
Iuliam significare, quam Caesar consul agrariam tulerat de [trium]viris
creandis, et per seditionem, quantum se habet fides historiae, et M.
Bibulo servante de caelo. In hanc Laterensis videtur iusiurandum
suum dicere noluisse * * ⁴⁶. Tamen M. Tullius non expressit ipsam
legis Iuliae mentionem, ne Caesaris animus laederetur. SCHOL. VAT.

state,’ cf. or. p. Rosc. Am. ἓ 148 sum ma res p. in huius periculo

last-quoted passage, the conception passes at once into the meaning
of ‘the supreme danger of the state‚' as in Cat. 111. ἓ 13 consului

ἓξ 53-55. Plancius is cleared of the suspicion of coalition (coitio)
i. e. a combz'natl'on of one candidate with another to prevent the election

Plancius Laterensis each with his own tribus, but that they refused to do

the result was uncertain, and refused to do the same again when the
result was fhreknawn and they saw that they were secure sor the next
election. Lat. had charged Plotius with coitio as well as Plancius, but
he had only prosecuted Plancius. Accordzngly, says Cicero, you show
