1. 32. ut fit in multis] ξ 33 l. 14.—exit] ‘gcts ab1·0ad‚’ or. p. Rosc.
Am. ἕ 2 nequaquam similiter oratio mea exire alque in vulgus emanare

poterit.

81 non—at tamen] ‘if not, yet at any 1·ate,’ ἓ 29 1. 12 si minus—-
at certe.

1. 33. non rusticum] a modest expression sor urbanum ‘clever,'
‘witty,’ as in de or. 11 ἓ 227 βιαία autem et urbana innumerabilia
vel ex una contione meministis, ξ 2 36. That Cic. in his speeches was
convinced of the rhetorical effect of wit is plain from several passages,
as de or. 1 ἓ 159, 11 ξ 219 multum in causis persaepe lepore et facetiis
(⁴ pleasantry and humour ²) prefici vidi, ib. ξ 227, ἓ 229, ἕ 236 est plane
oratoris movere risum ...... quod admirantur omnes acumen, uno saepe
in verbo posilnm, maxime respondentis, non numquam eliam lacessentis,
vel quod frangit advers-arima, quod impetiit quod elevat, vel quod ipsum
oratorem politum esse hominem significat, qnod eruditum, quod urbanum
cet., or. ξ 87 lmz‘cgeneri orationis aspergentur eticzm sales, qni in dicendo
nimium quantum valent, cet. He makes use therefore of wittieisms in
his speeches as well as in ordinary conversation. His bon-mols were
circulated freely. Caesar included some of them in his collection οἵ
ἀποφθέγματα, and as Cic. himself tells us (ep. ad fam. 11< 16 ξ 4) had
the tact to distinguish between what was really Cicero’s and what was
not: for Cic. complains (ad Fam. vu 32 quoted below 1. 3) that many
sayings were fathered on him, which he was not responsible for. C.
Trebonius made a similar collection (ep. ad fam. xv ἓ 2): also Cicero‘s
frecdman Tiro, if the three books ascribed to him are genuine. Macro-
bius doubts their genuineness (Saturn. 11 1 ξ 12), aud so does Quintilian
who (Inst. VI 3, 5) at the same time regrets their publication, as iu-
jurious to the orat0r⁷s reputation. Some of his jokes were very frigia
(in salibus aliquando frigidus, Quintil. XII 10§ 12), and as Laterensis
lest none of Cicero’s failings unnoticed, he upbraided him with his
passion sor humorous sayings (ἓ 85) in his speech against Plancius3
and if the wit, which he deprived Cic. of the opportunity of indulging,
was not to be of a higher order than such specimens we have of his,
as the pun on Verres’ name (or. in Verr. 1 ἓ 121, IV ἓ 95), it was
as well that the opportunity was lost. The whole of this passage from
ego-quia to constrantur is bracketed as spurious by Ko‘pke after Koe-
uighoff, Criticon et Exegeticon pars ΙΙΙ Trier 1861 p. 14.

Ρ. 1⁵, 1. 2. scitum] scitus is equivalent to our English word
‘knowing‚’ in the sense of ‘clever,’ ‘smart.’ See Ramsay's note on
Plautus Mostell. 1 3, 51. davisse dicunt] See Reid on de am. ξ 46.

1. 3. stomachor eum—conferuntur] Cf. ep. ad sam. vn 32, 1
ais, ut ego discesserim, omnia omnium dicta...in me conferri . Equi-
dem sperabam ita uelata me reliquisse genera dictorum meorum ut
cognosci sua sponte possent, sed qnoniam tanta faex est in urbe, ut nihil
lam sit ἀκύθηρον quod mm alicui venustum esse videatur, pugna, si me
amas, nisi acuta ἀμφιβολία, nisi elegans ὑπερβολή, nisi παράγραμμα
