APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXT

A. General Remarks

The text of this edition of the Planciana is founded mainly upon
that of Kayser as given in Vol. v of the excellent edition of Cicero’s
works edited by Baiter and Kayser and published by Β. G.
Tauchnitz, Leipzig, 1862. There is not much difference between the
text of their edition and that of Baiter in Orelli's Cicero ed. 2, Zurich
1856: in matters however of orthography it is geneially considered
superior. Kayser 's text is based upon two principal Mss: one (⁹1⁸)
from the monastery of Tegernsee in Bavaria, now in the library of
Munich (cod. Lat. 187 8*- ) first collated for Gaiatoni. It was lost sight
of for half a century, but luckily fell into the hands of Baiterl, who
bought it from a bookseller in Paris, whither it is said to have been
taken from Hungary. It is probably not earlier than the 11th century.
The second (E) was formerly at Erfurt, and is now at Berlin. Both
are derived apparently from one and the same original, which was cor-
rupt and interpolated. Thus in ch. x ἓ 26 Σ alone preserves the true
reading civili ferro, all the other MSS have civili errore, and in ch.

XXXIV ἓ 83 all MSS present the faulty reading ex illo ambitu traxisse,
sor exsilio ambitum sanxisse.

There are twenty-four MSS besides these which have been accurately,
and nine which have been inaccuratelycollated; of the former Laurenti-
anus tertius (Le), the third of those of the Medici Library at Florence, is
pronounced by WVunder to be the best, as it agrees more osten than any
other with '1' and Β. None appear to be older than the 15th century,
and they are all incomparably inferior to ¹1· and ΞΣ. Ψυηᾶεῐ points out
that there are only two passages in the whole speech, in which any one
of thern gives the right reading where '1¹ and E have a corrupt one, viz.
ἓ 47 where the latter have nam sor iam, and ἓ 95, z'n quo sor quod.

The most ancient Commentary on the Text is contained in a folio
now in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, to which it was brought
from the famous monastery of St Columba at Bobio about the be-
ginning of the 7th century. It is a codex rescrz'plus or palimpsest (the
superinduced MS containing a Latin translation of a portion of the Acts
