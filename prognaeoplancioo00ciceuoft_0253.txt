1. 25. Calidium] Q. Calidius. father of the orator, was tr. pl. in
B.C. 99=A. U. C. 655, and carried a law in this year for the recall of Q.
Metellus Numidicus from banishment‚ in gratitude sor which the son
Metellus Pius, when consul, supported him in his candidature sor the
praetorship. He was praetor urbanus in B.C. 79, praetor of Spain in
B.C. 78, On his return to Rome from his province he was accused in
the quaeslt'o de msscsnndis by Q. Lollius and found guilty in B.C. 77
(Verr.1 §38‚113§63).

Q. Metellus] Q. Caecilius Metellus C. f. Numidicus, the
most distinguished of the family of the Metelli, hence generally called
lllelellus ille Ν. by Cic. as or. p. Sest. ἓ 130, or. p. Arch. ξ 6, was consul
B.C. 109=A.U.C. 646 (Brut. ξ 135) with M.Junius Silanus, when he con-
ducted the war against Jugurtha in Numidia, as he did also in the fol-
lowing years as proconsul, with success. On the cause ofliis return to Rome
before the conclusion of the war see Cic. de oss. 111 ἓ 79 with my note.
In B.C. 100 the demagogue Saturninus carried his agrarian law. which
contained a clause that the senate should swear obedience to its pro-
visions within five days after its enactmcnt. Metellus refused to take
the oath. and, when Saturninus brought sorward a bill to punish him
with exile, voluntarily quitted the city, rather than risk disturbances in it,

Saturninus and the consequent ‹lissolution of his party very little oppo-
sition was offered to his recall, which was proposed in B.C. 90. tribunicia

convictus impunis ex iudicio discedat. Sic etiam L. Opimius et
Q. Calidius propter sua in rem p. merita non id sunt consecuti, ut
