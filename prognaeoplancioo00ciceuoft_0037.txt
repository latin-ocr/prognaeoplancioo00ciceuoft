INTRODUCTJON xxxiii
Planciana. As to WVunder's supposition that the sodales were
the managers of an election, it is sufficiently refuted by Long¹2².

ξ 22. Quite different from these sodalitates were the collegia,
which were voluntary associations founded on unity of occupa·
tion and intended to protect the real or supposed interests of
the several members. They were entitled to hold property sor
the general interest. Some of these bodies resembled our com-
panies3 thus we read of collegia opfictc11z¹23 at Rome, and in
the provinces there were collegia naviculariorum, or ‘companies
of ship and boat owners.' Others were of a religious character, as
the collegia pontificum, augurum, epulonum, fratrum arvalium,·
others were bodies concerned in administration as praetorum,

²²² ‘KVunder (Proh-gomma p.
LXXIV) supposes that certain men
named sodales, who were bribed
by a candidate, compelled or
brought together (cogebant) the
multitude to vote sor the briber;
ancl that to each sodalis a candi-
date assigned a certain part of a
tribe sor him to look after, and
that it was the business of these
supposed „costales to procure votes
for the candidates in whatever
way they could. But this is a
new meaning of the word sodales,
whereas the law would take the
word in the usual, old-established
acceptation; and, is it did not,
it would be necessary for the law
to give a new meaning to the
term and to define it; and how,
we may ask, could those election
agents appointed by the several
candidates form a sodalicium, when
the only connexion between them
was the fact of their working for
their employer, and sodalicium was
a term already used for clubs and
associations which were common
in Rome? Nor could the voting
be managed in such a way as
Wunder supposes, for men could

H

not be driven to the poll by force
(vi), and even if what we call un-
due influence and intimidation
were used, the voter had the ballot
to protect him, and the ballot was
effectual (or. p. Plane. ξ 16).'

lt’cp. Vol. lv p. 276, 1872. On
the other hand in his article on
ambitus Dict. of Antiq. p. 771)
a. 1853 the same writer says of
the lex Licinia that it was specially
directed against a particular mode
of canvassing, which consisted in
employing agents (sodales) to mark
out the members of the several
tribes into smaller portions, and
to secure more effectually the votes
by this division of labour. This
distribution of the tribes was called
decuriatio (or. p. Plane. ἓ 45).

123 These were the fabri aerarii
(Plin. N. H. 34, 1 ξ 1), lignarii,
fictores, firi-arii, aurficcs, fullones,
pistores, tibicines etfidicines Roma-
norum qui sacris publicis praesto
sunt. (The strike of the tibicines
recorded in Livy 1x 30 reads like
an account of a modern trades·
union). ef. Hor. Sat. 1. 2.
