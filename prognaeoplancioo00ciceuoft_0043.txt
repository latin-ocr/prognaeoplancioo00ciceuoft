INTROD UCTJON xxxvii

Those who wished to enter such a club and bind themselves
to its objects‚ had to give in their names to the president
(magister collegii), who might, as its founder, himself be the
candidate for office. They were then enrolled (conscmjhli) and
made membcrs collegii sodalicii, subsequently subdividcd into
bands of ten (decuriati), each of which was presided over by a
decuriam. The object of this subdivision was that the whole
body might be more easily controlled. What was done for
a candidate in his own tribus could be done for him by his
friends in the remaining tribesffl. Cicero himself speaks of
activity among the sodalicia as discriptio papuli, by which he
could only mean the organisation of the people outside the
candidate's tribus through the agency of other clubs.

§25 It was against such combinations as these that the
lex Licinia de sodaliciis was directed, which was passed in
Rc. 53, in the consulate (second) of Pompeius Magnus and
M. Licinius Crassus Dives. Its object was not so much
to pass a severer sentence on corrupt practices in elections*
the legal enactments against ambitus were sufficient sor that
purpose-—as to prevent the formation of societies, which com-
bined to make gain out of political questions, and, if necessary,
to proceed to acts of violence. It applied therefore not only to
those who obtained office by the help of clubs but also to
persons out of office, if they had organised clubs and used them
for the promotion of any political schemes.

So, when M. J. Laterensis accused Gnaeus Plancius under
the lex Licinia de sodaliciis and yet could only bring forward
charges of ordinary ambitus, his object in so doing was to put
in force every form of severity that the law admitted, among
which may be mentioned the rule that even persons absent
on the public service were obliged to put in an appearance,
just as in causae de vi138, and to procure the infliction of
