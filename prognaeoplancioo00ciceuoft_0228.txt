nesses more in number than the votes which he got in that tribus. He
could not mean to say that those who voted sor him were bribed, but if
the tribe was bribed, he must, as Cic. says, either be producing some
men as witnesses who for a bribe had voted against him, or if they were

tribe was bribed' (ᾖσας). Wunder takes Cicero's meaning to be : the
testimony of the witnesses whom Laterensis brings forward from the
Pbllt'nsa tribus is inaclmissible. For either they were bribcd by Plancius
not to vote for Laterensis, in which case they cannot be witnesses, since
they were bribed3 or else in their disinterested zeal without being bribed
they voted for Plancius rather than Laterensis, in which case it is not
likely that they will appear as witnesses against Plancius, unless Lare-
rensis has bribed them to do so

Taurii and Apollinares were frequently held, and the people and senate
sometimes assembled when it was necessary to convene thern outside the
walls. It was situated in the district which lies between the southern
part of the Via Lala or the modern Corso, and the Tiber, not sar from
the Capitol. It is hy some misplaced in the modern Piazza Navona.
