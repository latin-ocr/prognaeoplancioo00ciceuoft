ἓξ 55-57, But 11 15 plain enough that in prosecuting Plancius you
rely on something more than these facts t you rely upon your general
influence and name to 6111511 Plancius, who has many personal 6116111165

evidence in cases of ambitus. Cicero entreats the iudices to undertake
the business of cross-examining these witnesses and to relieve his own
modesty from the unpleasant task‚ seeing they were his friends, and not
to give any heed to idle reports about the defendant.
