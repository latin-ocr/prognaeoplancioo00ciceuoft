196 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XL §96—

the Greek town Hipponium, on the west coast of Bruttium, on the
shores of the bay named aster it sinus Hipponiates or Vibonen-
sis, now the guls of St Eufemia. Originally a colony of the Locri
Epizephyrii, it was destroyed by Dionysius in Β. C. 389 but restored by
the Carthaginians in B.C. 379, soon after which it sell into the hands of
the Bruttii. Upon the close of the second Punic war, the Romans
colonised it, and gave it the name of Vibo Valentia. Cicero speaks
of it (Verr. 11 5 ἓ 40) as an illustre nobileque municipium, and Appian
B. C. lv 3, as one of the most flourishing cities in Italy. Its position
rendered it a convenient place to touch at in passing from or to Sicily.
Thus we find Cicero in B.C. 44 proceeding a Vibone ad Veliam par-
vulo navigio, and thence to Rhegium, Verr. 11 2 §99, cs. cp. ad Att.
XVI 6, 1 petvenz'...aa' Vibonem octavo die e Pompeiano, cum unum
diem Veliae constitissem. The modern city Monte Leone occupies
the same site.

Brundisium] the modern Brindisi, a town in Calabria on the
coast of the Adriatic, colonised by the Romans in Β. C. 244, was their
chief naval station in those seas on account of the excellence of its
harbour (Brun disin m pulcro praccinclum praepete portu Ennius Ann-
V1 53). It was the terminus os the via Appia, and its position, as the
usual place of embarkation sor Greece and the Eastern provinces,
naturally rendered it the scene of many historical incidents during the
end of the Republic and under the Empire. See Dict. Geogr. s. v. Vol. 1
p. 445. Cf. ep. ad Att. 111 4 a Vibone subito discessimus....Illo (sc.
fines lege praescriptos) cum pervenire non liceret, statim iler Brun·
disium versus contuli ante diem rogationis, ne et Sicca, apud quem eram,
periret et quod Allelitae esse non licebat.
