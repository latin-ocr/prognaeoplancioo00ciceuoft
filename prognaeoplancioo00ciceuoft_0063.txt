The bill of Clodius directed against those who had put
a Roman citizen to death without a direct vote osthe
people⁵⁵. Cic.humiliates himself. Caesarisstillbesore
the gates of Rome when Cic. leaves the city. The bill
of pains and penalties against Cicero is enacted aster
he had lest Rome. From Rome he goes to Vibo,
Tarentum and the suburbs of Brundisium: thence
he sails to Dyrrhachium and from Dyrrhachium goes
to Thessalonica, where he meets with a philosophie
comforter in Cn. Plancius-⁵⁶, through whose kind-
ness he is enabled to live in security from May to
November. Meantime at Rome his splendid house
on the Palatine is demolished, and part of the ground
on which it stood is dedicated and a temple built
thereon to Liberty, and his country-houses at For-
miae and Tusculum are destroyed⁵⁷. Cicero's bro-
ther returns to Rome from his government of Asia.
Pompeius comes no more into public during the
tribunate of Clodius: he does what he can to restore
Cic. from exile.

Towards the end of Nov. Cic. goes to Dyrrhachium ⁵⁸,
so that he might be nearer Italy and to avoid meet-
ing Piso, the new Governor of Macedonia.

Comitia centuriata, arriving at Brundisium the
next day⁵⁹. There he was met by his daughter
Tullia. On the 8th‚ hearing ot' the success of the
bill sorbis restoration, he set out at once for Rome,
where he arrived on September the 4th. He
