NOTES

ἐξ 1—4· (Exordium) Summary

ἓ r. Rejoiced as 1 was to see Plancius so warmly supported, when
he was a candidate sor the aedileship, by many loyal and respectable
citizens, who remembered how kindly he befricndcd me during my
exile in Macedonia, Ι am more grievcd and annoyed to think that so
many of my own personal encmies and opponents should now take part
against him in this trial, simply and solcly because of the kind reception
he thcn gave me. ξ 2. I am, however, reassured by sceing in those
who have to try the case men who have given ample proof of their
affection for me, and to whom I owe an everlasting (lebt of gratitude for
their sympathy with my troubles and from whose goodwill toward my-
self 1 augur the best for my client. lndeed 1 am more surprised at an
old friend like Laterensis undertaking this case than afraid of your
supposing he has done so on adequate grounds. ἓ 3. Not that these
services of Plancius ought to give him a general claim to exemption
from punishment, if he can be proved to deserve it. 1 hope to convince
you of my client’s claim to your respect on account of his many virtues
independently, before I appeal to your kind consideration of his case in
return sor the compassion he bestowed upon myself in my reverse of
fortune. ξ 4. The case presents special difficulties, chiefly on account
of the course pursued by my opponents, in attacking myself indirectly
through Plancius and pretending that his services towards me have been
overstated or overrated, so that 1 have to vindicate my own conduct as
well as that of my client. „
