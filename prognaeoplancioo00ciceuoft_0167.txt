revenues (vcctzgralia) had become a body of importance as early as the
second Punic War (Liv. XXIII 48, 49), and their numbers, weulth and
influence increased with the extension of the Roman empire and the
increase os its revenue. The socz'0²(aeztt*.r‚ or joint stock companies, by
which they were enabled to carry on the undertaking of farming the
revenues of a large province, were composed chiefly of members os the
ordo equestris, who were in reality the class of monied men. In fact,
the Equs, as a body, may be said to have had a monopoly of this
department of mercantile speculati0n3 and in all matters relating to the
collection of the public revenue Eqm'lcs and Public-ani became con-
vertible terms. The l’ublz'cani were always treated with great respect3
and by Cicero, who had, however, a special object in view, they are
complimented in the most high-ssowu lang¹ ‘zui qe in the present passage.
