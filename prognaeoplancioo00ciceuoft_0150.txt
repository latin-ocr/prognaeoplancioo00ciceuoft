1. 14. grave] sc. iudicibus, ‘a serious matter for the court to
pronounce, He (Plancius) is more (leserving than the other (I 3161·6115ἰ5).’
‘How then is it more equitahle that he should be elected lather than
the other?’ In this way, I take it. for 11616 lies the point, this' 15 enough
sor the judge, ‘he was elected. ' ‘Why your client rither than 11115611>

not properly electedz’ which would be a very slisagreeable assertion to
make, though Ι ought not to be punished sor making it.’

liceat, quam tandem rationem. cur sactus Plancius sit, auferre magis
convenit? Hanc puto, quod Plancius sactus est. IV.

CHAPTER VII

§g 17—30. But this is not all; without comparing your respective
persoual merits 1 can justil'y the people’s choice of Plancius and
