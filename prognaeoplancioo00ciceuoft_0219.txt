1.. caesaris] L. Julius L. f. Sex. n. Caesar (elder brother of
C-Julius Caesar Strabo one of the interlocutors in the dialogue de oratore,
cf. de off. 1§ 108, ἓ ¹33) was consul in B.C. 90 with P. Rutilius Lupus
when the Soeial War broke out. (He must not be confounded, as he is
by Appian B. C. 1 40 with Sextus Julius Caesar, uncle of the Dictator
who was consul Rc. 9 ι). He carried a law (lex Iulia de cz'vz'tale sociorum)
which enfranchised all corporate communities in Italy, except those
which had joined in the rebeHion, provided that they sormally consented
to be incorporated as Romani cives, or. pro Balb. ἓ 21, Aul. Gell. n. a.

in B. C. 87, he and his brother, being opposed to Marius and Cinna.
were killed by Fimbria (Tusc. V ἓ 55, de orat. 111 ἓ 10, Val. Max. lx
2 ἕ 2).

1. 7. Gn. Octavii] Gnaeus Octavius, grandson, son and father of
a consul, was himself consul in B.C. 87 (Brut. ξ 176) with L. Cornelius
Cinna. He was one of the staunch supporters of the aristocratical
party, which was perhaps the reason that he failed in obtaining the
aedileship. After Sulla⁷s departure from Italy to carry on the war
against Mithridates, Cinna tried to obtain the power for the Marian
party by incorporating the new Italian citizens among the thirty-five
tribes, and thus a contest arose between the two consuls, which ended
in the expulsion of Cinna srorn the city. But Cinna soon returned with
Marius at the head of an army against the city, which was coinpelled to
surrender, and Octavius was one of the first victims in the massacres
which followed. This is called the bellum Octavianum, Vell. Pat. 11 20,
