1. 23. negoclatoribus—mercatoribus] sc. visus eram. The two
classes are distinguished, Verr.11 2 ξ 188 mercator an negociator an
arator. The former were the Roman money-lenders, bankers and
merchants on a large scale, who bought up corn on speculation; the
latter traders who went about with their goods and trafficked with the
natives, Long Vcrr. II 2 6 ἓ 16, Ramsay [ι’. Α. p. 431.

mancipibus] the publicam· who sarmed the decumae. According to
Pseudo-Ascon. in Cic. Div. in Q. C. ἓ 33 they were publicanorum

1. 28. cum casu diebus iis—forte venissem] ‘on coming to
Puteoli, sor the purpose of continuing my journcy by land, which, as
chance would have it, I did just at the height of the season.' Cicero
landed at Puteoli in order to proceed thence by land to Rome
(z'tincrz’ssacicmli causa) as in the well-known instance of St Paul (Act.
Apost. XXVIII 13), ancl it so happened that his visit was just at the
time when Puteoli was sull of sashionable visitors. He seems to lay
stress on the fact of his visit being accidentally at such a time, lest it
should be supposed that he courted an ovation. Puteoli (hod.
Fozzuoli) was a famous seaport-town of Campania on the east side of
the sinus Baianus. It was founded by the Greeks of Cumae ΚΟ. 521
under the name of Dicaearchia, and the name was changed to Puteoli
because of its many ‘wells' (putei) in the second Punic XVar, when it
was fortified by the Romans. A colony was established there in Β. C.
194, and, being the first really good port on the south of Rome, it
became one of the most considerable emporiums of foreign trade in
Italy (Strabo, XVII p. 793), and also, like Baiae and its neighbourhood,
a favourite resort of the Roman nobility. Cicero himself had a villa
between it and the lake Avernus, which he called his Academia, other-
wise Puteolanum. The modern town retains many remains of its
former grandem, the most famous of which are the temple of Serapis,
and the piles or piers of its ancient mole. Festus [Paul. Diae. p. 122
Mult] says of it: Minorem Delum. Puteolos csse dclxerunt, quod Delos
aliquando maximum emporzunz suerit lolius orbis terrarum: cui suc·
