in the second consulship of Pompeius and Crassus, he became
a candidate for the aedileship sor the following year, B.C. 54.
It has been already stated (p. xv> that the elections were not
completed in this year-44 but postponed till the following -in
consequence of some protest. His competitors were A. Plo-
tius45, Q. Pedius and M. Juventius Laterensis⁴⁶; he was
elected together with A. Plotius to hold the public games, as
curule aedile47, for the remainder of the year. At his election
he was supported by the hearty co-operation of his friends and
townsrnen3 the friendship of Cicero and the social inssuence of
his father were also a considerable help to him. The two
tribes Teretina48 and Voltinia ³⁹ were interested in his behalf
because of his birthplace. It was not surprising that Laterensis
failed, for relying on his high birth and social rank he had taken
little or no trouble to secure his election. At first C. Plancius,
it appear5‚ wished for him as his colleague in the aedileship,
since at the first comitia in Β. C. 55 he seems to have obtained
sor him the votes of the tribes that were friendly to himself.
But owing to the indifference shown by Laterensis in his canvass
Cn. Plancius abandoned all hope of serving him, and as he ran
the risk of losing his own election by supporting such an un-
popular rival, he effected a coalition with A. Plotius at the
second comitia and was ultimately chosen aedile with him ⁵0.
