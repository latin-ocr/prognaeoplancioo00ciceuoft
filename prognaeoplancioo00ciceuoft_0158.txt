frequently spoken of by Cicero in conjunction with C. Fabricius Lusci-
nus and M‘. Curius Dentatus as a pattern of primitive Roman virtue
and simplicity (de sen. ᾖ 43, de am. ἓ 18, ξ 39, de nat. deor. 11 ξ 165,
Brut. ἓ 55). According to Tacitus he was a native of Camerium (Ann.
XI 24), and Orelli (Onomast. p. 199) thinks that Cicero must have com·
mitted a σφάλμα μνημονικὸν in speaking os him as a Tusculan by birth,
though Ellendt imputes the error to Tacitus (u. on de orat. 111 ἓ 56),
while XVunder thinks that the Tusculans conserred the franchise on
him, as the burgesses of Tarentum did on Archias, see or. p. Arch-
ἓ 5. Though only a novus homo (de sen. ἓ 15) he w'as promoted to all
the chief osfices of state, to the consulship Α. U.c. 474=B.C. 280, when
he crushed an insurrection in Etruria, the censorship in B-C. 270. In
Β. C. ²54 hc was made pontt-'fix maximus, being the first plebeian raised
to that (lignity‚ and in Β. C. 246 he was appointed dictator sor the pur-
pose of holding the comitia in the absence of the consuls. Cicero osten
praises him and speaks of him as one of those whose greatnets was
owing to a special Providence, de nat. deor. 11§ 165 qnorum neminem
nisi iuvante deo talem ficisse credendum est. He is described as peritissi-
mus pmztz'sex <de domo ἓ 139y cp. <le nat. d. 1 ἓ 115, 111 ἓ 5, de leg. 11

1. 2. de tot Fulviis] The Fulvia gens was plebeian¹ but one of
the most illustrious of the Roman gentes. The principal families in it
were those of Flaccus, Nobilior, Centumalus, Paetinus and Curvus. To
the last belonged L. Fulvius Curvus, who was the first of the gens who
rose to be consul, Β. C. 32 2. Cf. Plin. nat. hist. VH 43 est et L. Ful-
vius inter inszgm'a exempla : nam Tusculanorum rebellantium consul
codem honore cum transibat, exornatus est confestim a l). le. qui solus
eodem anno, quo fuerat hostis, triumphavit cx z‘is, quorum consul suerat.

The last Fulvius who enjoyed a well-earned reputation scarcely
reached to Cicero's time, having been consul B.C. 125. He was the
first who subdued the Transalpine Liguriam, over whom he celebrated
a triumph B.C. 123. Fulvia. the wife of Antoniis, was the daughter
of M. Fulvius Bambalio, a member of this gens, hence Cic. (Phil. 111
§ 16), in reply to the taunt of Antonius that Octavian’s mother was a
native of Aricia, says ‘si Aricinam uxorem uon probas, ιιιν probas
Tusculanam ,θ’

1. 3. Arpinatem] native of Arpinum, which was an ancient
town of the Volscians to the east of Rome near the junction of the
Liris and Fibrenus (de legg. 11 ἓ 3). It was taken from the Volscians
by the Samnites, and from them Β. C. 305 by the Romans. In B. C. 302
it was made a munz'ctpz'um sinesqfffragia and it was not until A.U.C. 563
