centuria praerogativa] ‘ the century to which it fell by lot to vote
first in the comitia.⁷ Its vote was looked upon as an indication of the
will of heaven (praerqfflzlz'vam maiores omen—comiliorum esse voluerunt,
de div. 1 §45), and as such, was followed in elections at least by a
majority of the centuries, cs. Liv. XXVI η, 2. Ramsay R. A. p. 119.

1. 4. ut. nemo umquam eam tulefit cet] ‘that no one has ever
carried it, i.e. been voted for by it, without afterwards being declared
‹luly elected the first of the two consuls either at that very election‚ or
if not, at all events sor the current year.'

Gr. p. 45 .

prior] cf. or. in Pis. 1 ἓ 2 me quaestorem in primis, aedilem
priorem, praetorem primum cunctis sztffragz'z‘s pop. Rom. faciebat,
or. p. Mur. ἓ 3 5 z'n praeturae petitione prior renunciatus cst.

1. 6. in inum annum] i.e. the current year, for which the comitia
for the electiori of consuls was held. If the vote of the praerogativa
had such influence in determining the election to the consulate, can
Laterensis be surprised at Plancius' election to the aedileship, when he
had the praerogativa not merely of the part of a tribe, but of the whole
comitia, i. e. when his prior election made his second election certain?

1. 7. 'm quo] ‘in whose case‚’ ‘when in his case,' an adjectival
causat clause, Kenn. Gr. p. 451. Observe that Cic. speaks of the cen-
turia praerogativa as exigua pars populi opposed to populus universus ,-
and as unius tribus pars in opposition to tribus omnes or tota comitia.

1. 8. euius in honore] ‘ in whose electiori to a state office.’
