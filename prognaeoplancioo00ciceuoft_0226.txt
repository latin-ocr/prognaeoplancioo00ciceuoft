curules. Fieri tamen poterat, et ut plures quam duo peterent, et ut
plures etiam pares suffragiis essent. Quod si accideret, constitutum est
a maioribus, ut sortirentur, quinam ex iis aedilitatem gererent. Sin
autem soli duo totidem suffragia tulissent, sortitio locum non habebat.

MANUTIUS

ἓ ⁵4, 1. 7. et, ais] the third argument of Laterensis, by which he
really accuses himself of an intended coitio.

Aniensem] the tribus of Plotius, as the Teretina was that of
Plancius, ξ 21 l. ¹5› ξ 38 l. 1.

1. 9. ab utroque] i-e. by Plotius and Plancius, the former of
whom did not help Pedius nor the latter Laterensis at the second
electionrwith their respective tribus, for they searcd they might want the
votes of these tribus themselves.

ne :ln angustum venirent] ‘lest they (Plotius and Plancius) should
bei reduced to a struit, be placed in an awkward position ;' i.e. by losing
the necessary votes of those trihus themselves. ‘Ipsius Laterensis
haec verba fuisse, quibus significaverit κα necessariis szffvgiis ipsi pri-
varentur, ex sequentibus intellegitur, in quibus Cicero ridiculum hoe
· loquendi genus reddit.’ WUNDER. Angmmm is used substantively as
in (le off. 1 ἕ 53, de arn. ξ 20, acad. 1§ 38 cnm cas (perturbationes)

need to say that quam is for (luam mm or quam parum, ef. or. p. Sull.

1.1o. nondum cognita populi voluntate] superioribus comitiis,
cum Plotius et Plancius de populi erga se voluntate, quam postea latis
suffragiis cognoverant, certi nihil scirent. MANUTIUS

iam tum] i.e. nondum cognita populi voluntate. Before
the first election Plancius and Plotius could not know the feeling of
the people about them, Cicero therefore argues that there is no con-
sistency in the assertion that Pedius and Plancius, who were according
to Laterensis then in coalition (coniunctas), should have generously
sacrificed their own tribus to help him (Lar), when the result was·
uncertain, and yet should refuse to do so when they knew they must be

secure sor the next election.

1. 11. suarum tribuum] in quibus censentur. Quozut eo.

1. 13. restrictos et tenacis] ‘ niggardly and stingy‚' perhaps with
a reference to the words of Laterensis ηε in [tufts-vlunt vmirent. On
the meaning of resta-ictas see n. to de off. ΙΙ ξ 63 l. 14, and for tenax cf.
