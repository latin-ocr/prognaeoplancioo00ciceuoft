were to try the case. In trials under all other laws, the jury was chosen
by lot from all ihe tribes, and both prosecutor and deffendant were allowed
to challenge them (reicere). The scna‘te in conjerrz'ng this exceptional
potuer on the prosecutor supposed that he would be likely to name the tribes
which the accused was suspected of having corrupted, in which case the
same parties would be both witm‘sses and jury. Now if the ‹hstndanffls
own tribe or a tribe ‘totth which he was closely connected, was chosen
as one of the tribes to select the jury from, the defendant could not object.
But Laterensis, contraiy to the intention (ff the senate in passing,² the law,
did not choose the tribes willa which Plancius had intimate relations and
which he charged him with corrupting‚ but others with which he had no
connexion whatever. that reasonable inference may be drawn from
this? either that Laterensis was guilty ‘ff such severity, as was not
contemplated by the law, or else that he did not believe that the two
tribes, wlzidz he declined to name, had been corrupted by Plancius.
Plancius did much to merit the affi’ction of his fellow-tribesmen. He
helped them in difficulties, and got places sor many of them through his
fathcr⁷s influence: and surely it τινας never intended that the leges de
ambitu should put a stop to all those ordinary arts and expedimus
by which popularity and influence is secured in a man's own tribe.
Let Laterensis but prove his case that Plancius corrupted the tribes by
means (ff sodalicia, and then I shall wonder why he did not use
the weapons provided for him by the lex Licinia, why he did not nanze
Plancius‘ own tribe and any other which he chaiges him with having
bribed. Plancius can show how he got the votes of the tribes which
voted fhr him quite as easily as Laterensis can show how he himself
got the votes of any cf them (ἓ 36—43).
