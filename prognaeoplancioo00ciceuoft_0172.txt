1. 5. an Minturnenses -mirarisj an goes with miraris, the anti-
thesis (Mmturnenses coloni—versantur), which serves as a soil to bring
out the thought and w hich we should bring' m as a subordinate clause
by ‘while,' ‘whereas² being coordinated asa main clause; just as in
Greek such antitheses are regularly introduced by μέν and δέ (Buttmann
Gr. Gr. p. 396 ed. 1833). See Madv. Gr. §438, my n. to de off. 1
,ξ 114 l. ¹7 and cp. below ξ 41 l. 3² n. The train of thought is as follows:
⁶ or is it the case that, while the people of Minturnae are immortalised
for affording shelter to Marius in his exile, you are surprised at Plancius
being honoured as he was sor the protection he accorded me?' ‘Iam
narratum a me hoc exemplum plenissime scio de C. Mario, qui Sullanis

quoniam non potuisset occidi, navigio impositus in Africam pervectus

Minturnenses] the pcople of Minturnae, which was a city of
Latium, on the via Appia, on the right bank of the Liris, on thc borders
osan extensive marsh, about three miles from the sea (Strab. v. p. 233).
A colonia vmrilz'mcz with the rights os Roman citizens was established
there in B.C. 296 (Liv. X 21, Vell. Pat. 1 14). In B.C. 88 C. Marius,
when flying from Rome by sea, was compelled to put in at the mouth of
the Liris, and,endeav·ou1ing to conceal himself' in the mmshes, was
dragged srorn thence and imprisoned by order of the magistiates ot
Minturnae, who however afterwards released him and put him on
board a ship which conveyed him to Africa. Cf. or. p. Sest. ἓ 50 menu-
