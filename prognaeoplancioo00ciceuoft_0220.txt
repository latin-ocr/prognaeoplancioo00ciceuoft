¹24 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XXI §52

1. 11. 1.. Philippus] Lucius Marcius Philippus Q. f. Q. n. was
tribune of the plebs ΒΩ. 103, in which year he brought sorward a law
chiefly memorable sor his statement that there were not 2000 men of
property in the state (de off. 11 ξ 73 where see my note). In 13.C. 100
he was one of those who took up arms against Saturninus. He was a
candidate for the consulship ΒΕ. 93 but defeated by Herennius (Brut.
ἓ 166, or. p. Mur. ἓ 36), consul 13.C. 91 with Sextus Julius Caesar, when
he distinguished himself by his oppositiou to the mensures of the tri-
bune M. Livius Drusus (above ξ 33, de legg. 11 ἓ 31, or. p. dom.§
41, ἕ 50), censor B.c. 86 with M. Perperna. Cicero speaks very highly
of him in several passages, or. p. Mur. ἓ 36, p. Quinct. ἓ 72, Brut. ξ 173
where as a speaker he is said to have summa libertas, multae facetiae,
and to be satis creber ὺι reperiendis, solutus in explicandis sententiis
(see n. on de off. 1 ἓ 108). He is the same as the Philippus of whom
Horace (Ep. 1 7, 46) tells the well-known anecdote.

summa. nobilitate] Fabri on Livy xm 1, 4 gives several instances
in xx hich the genitive of quality accompanies a Proper Name enthetieally
without an appellative (liena. Gr. p. 415), Liv. XXII 60, 5 T. Manlius

1.12. C. caelius] Gaius Caelius Caldus was consul B..C 94
with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, being the first of his family to obtain
any curule office (or. p. Mur. ἓ 17, Verr. V§ 180). He was tribune of
the plebs B.C. 107, when he proposed a lex tabellam, which provided
thatp in the courts of justice voting by ballot should apply to cases of
high treason also (perduellio), hitherto exeepted from the operation of
the lex Cassia B.C. 137 (Plin. ep. 111 πο). In the civil war ΒΕ. 83 he
was a supporter of Marius. Q. Cic. de pet. cons.§ 11 quanto melior
tihi fortuna petitionis data est qnam nuper homini novo C. Caelio!
Ille cum duobus hominibus ita nobilissimis petebat, ut tamen in eis
omnia pluris essent quom ipsa nohz'le'taj...Ac samm eorum alterum
Ca elius, cum multo infirior esset genere, superior nulla re paene,
superavit. As a speaker, he did not rise above mediocrhy, Brut.

1. 13. Rufus] P. Rutilius Sp. f. Sp. n. Rufus (de off. 11
ξ 47), famous as soldier, orator and man of letters, was consul in
13.C. 105, and in 13.C. 99 legatus under Ω. Mucius Scaevola when pro-
consul of Asia. While acting in this capacity, by repressing the illegal
extortions of the tax-collectors (publicani) he incurred the hatred of the
equestrian body. Accordingly on his return to Rome he was unjustly
arraigned of malversation (de repetundis», found guilty and compelled to
withdraw into banishment in B.C. 9² <Athenaeus IV. p. 168 Α παρὰ. δὲ
