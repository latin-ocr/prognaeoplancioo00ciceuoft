PREFACE

THE Plancz‘czna is not included in -any English edition of
select orations of Cicero, nor has any separate edition of it
ever been published with English notes. And yet it must be
regarded as one ofCicero's best, if not so choice a specimen
of formal perfectiori as the Affilonicmcz, or of such historica]
importance as the lf'erm'ues or Catz‘llbmrians. ‘There is no
tearing of any enemy to tatters,' as Mr Anthony Trollope
well remarks in his Life es Cicer-0, ‘but there is much pathos
and a few passages in it of peculiar force.' Such are the
orator’s lively comments on the caprice of the people in
their appointment of magistrates, on the relation between
a candidate for office and his electors‚ and on the arts of
electioneering3 on the use of the ballot3 on political con-
sistency: such is the famous comparison between the
pecuniae debitio et gratiae, and such again the beautiful
irony with which he ridicules the pretensions of the pro-
secutor.

It is the more surprising then, that while other speeclics
of Cicero have been edited and re-edited, this has lain in
comparative neglect. Wunder‘s edition, ‘which’ it has
been said ‘may sasely be pronounced to be the most
elaborate, is not the ablest‚ edition of any of Cicero's
works,' has been long out of print, and K‘opke's is prac-
tically useless, the notes being written in German. No
apology therefore seems to be needed for the publication
of a new edition with English notes for the use of students
at the University and for boys at public schools.
