ἓ 11. The election to State offices (honores) was carried
chiefly through the votes of the candidate's own tribus. It was
the object therefore of himself and his friends to secure the votes
of this and of as many as they could of the remaining 34⁷⁵.
Accordingly Cicero by his recommendation of Plancius made a
zealous effort to win the tribes to his side⁷⁶. The same was
done by others for their friends, as by Caesar and by Clodius-5⁷.
Resides such recommendations, the candidate’s friends busied
themselves in obtaining votes for him by giving public ban-
quets to the tribes (couvi-via tributim datam, by assigning re-
served places to the tribules at the gladiatorial and other shows
(spectacula tributim data)⁷⁹. To obtain the votes of a tribe for
a friend by these and such means was called tribum conficere.
They were criminal if employed not tributim but vulgo tri-
butim, that is, among the whole people in their 33 tribes.

ξ 12. then a man had a number of tribes in his favour,
he might increase that number by coalition with another candi-
date so as to unite their interests‚ in order to throw out a third
who was likely to prove formidable to either singly. This was
called tribum conferre or concedere-8⁰. Thus, if one of the two
candidates had nine tribes and the other as many other tribes,
by forming a coalition (coitio) both candidates together might
secure 18 and so an absolute majority of the whole 35 tribes.
Cicero himself held this to be a perfectly legal method of elec-
tioneering‚ and assisted at such coalitions himself, as may be
inferred from a letter to his brother Quintusssl. Other evi-
dences of coalition are given by Asconius in his commentary
on Cicero’s speech ἱνι loga candida 3²², which was directed against
