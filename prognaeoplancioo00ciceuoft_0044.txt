the punishment already applicable to cases of vis: and also in
order that he might bring the defendant before an extraordinary
tribunal, the iudices editicii—a court employed only in cases of
res tribuaria, and which could not take cognizance of any other,-
even of ambitus. And when then, in spite of this, Cicero speaks
of M. Licinius Crassus as Icarum ipsarum legum ambitus
auctor i.e. as the author of these decrees against ambitus¹3⁰‚
he cannot mean any kind of ambitus but that practised by such
sodales and sequestres.

is shown by the above passages, the association of sodales, the
formation and organisation of clubs in pursuit of political ends ;

it forbade canvassing and registering (conscribere) men in the
several tribes and subdividing those who belonged to the same
tribus into bodies of ten (decurtare), and in like manner mark—
ing out the several tribes into districts (populum &scriberem it
forbade the employment of sequestres or intermediaries for
holding deposit-money, the promising of money (pronunliare),
the doling it out (dividere) and the sale to others of votes
obtained by briberylffl.

According to Cicero not one of these offences could be

influential, but that was no reason why he should be suspected
of electioneering intrigues. Ifothers had worked by means of
clubs in the interest of Plancius, it was they, not Plancius, who
should be impeached.
