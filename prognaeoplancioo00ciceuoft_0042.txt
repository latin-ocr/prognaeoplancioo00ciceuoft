reckoned. As sodalicius is an adjective¹³¹‚ the full title is
collegia sodalicia, as it appears in inscriptions and in the
Digest5132. They were really a revival of the sodalitates in
another form. In so sar as they were associations of members
of tribes sor the pursuit of a definite object, they were collegia.
But as they resembled the original sodalitates in the support
which their members afforded to each other in the courts of
justice, in popular assemblies and at electioris, these collegia
were sodalicia. Thus they were political clubs within the tribus,
founded often by the candidates themselves, as by P. Clodius
in B.C. -58, Their principal, if not their only, aim was to or-
ganise and retain in their own hands a system of bribery133, so
as, if possible. to divert any charge of ambitus from the candi·
dates to themselves, trusting to their numbers to afford them
security. So the old evil reappeared in a new form. Hence
such a collegium is calledffl a consensio quae magis honeste
quam vere sodalitas nominatur, because it is not really a
sodalitas in the primary sense of the word. But since each
member of a collegium sodalicium may be also spoken of as a
sodalis, we find Cicero in ξ 46 saying cupidos et gratiosos—tu
si sodalis vocas, officiosam amicitiam nomine inquinas cri·
minoso.

§ 24. The crimen sodalicii, therefore, which formed the acte
d’accusation of Gnaeus Plancius, was for the organisation of
clubs in order to exercise undue influence over the elections135.
But Laterensis, in order to gain his cause, must prove, which he
failed to do, these facts :—Plancium decuriasse, conscripsisse,
sequestrem fuisse, pronunciasse, divisisse, that he had planned
a decuriatio tribulium and a discriptio populi.
