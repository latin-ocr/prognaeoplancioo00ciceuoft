INTRODUCTJON xliii
by the disqualification of some nominees or by the drawing oflots
or finally by the challenging of the parties to the suit, so that
the proper number fixed by the lex Aurelia of 3><25=75
iudices out of the three orders was obtainedlffl.

§31. It was the composition of the jury according to the
lex Pompeia which first made the lex Lz'cim'a possible. The
senatus-consullum, on the lines of which the latter law was
framed, passed in February Β. C. 56152. It expressed the neces-
sity for a law to punish the sodalitates decuriatique, who would
not submit to a voluntary dissolution. Disturbances hindered
the law from passing as early as B. C. 56, but in the next year it
was brought forward and enacted in the consulate (second)
of Cn. Pompeius and M. Licinius Crassus aster the
latter of whom it was named.

The constitution of the Jury under this lex Licinia was pe-
culiar, though there is no evidence that the prosecutor named
thern153. All Cicero says is that the prosecutor named (edidit) the
four tribes, of whom the accused could reject one and the jury
were chosen out of the remaining three. The accuser was ex—
pected to name the tribes in which the crime of sodalicz'mn was
said to have been committedffl: but Laterensis did not name the
tribes he suspected, and in so doing, though ‘he was strictly
within the letter of the law, he failed to observe its spirit.

As the prosecutor named the tribe only, and the iudices of
senatorial rank were not categoried by tribes, it is obvious that
the editio iudicum applied only to equites and tribuni aerarii.
The tribes named by Laterensis were the Lemonia, Olgsentina,

according to the thirty-five tribes
are representatives to a certain
degree of the whole Roman
people. Hence Cicero can say,
