1. 24. Opimium] L. Opimius, who as consul in B.C. 121 with
Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus (Brut. ἓ ⁴287) took the lead in the
proceedings which ended in the murder of Gaius Gracchus, Philipp. Vl11
14, Cat. 1 §4³ or. part. 30, 104, 106. In 13.C. ¹20 he was accused by
Q. Decius, tribune of the plebs, of having put Roman citizens to death
without a trial, defended by the consul C. Papirius Carbo (qui nihil de
C. Gracchi nece negabat scd id iure pro salute patriae sactum esse dicebat,
de or. 11 §106) and acquitted. He was condemned however 11 years
afterwards under the bill of C. Mamilius Limetanus sor enquiring into
the conduct of all those who had received brihes from Jugurtha (he had
been sent with others to divide the dominions of Micipsa between Ju-
gurtha and Adherbal), and went into exile to Dyrrhachium, where he
died (SCHOL. BOB. p. 311, or. in Pis. §95, or. p. Sest. ἓ 140, de orat. 11
ἓ 106, or. in Cat. 11 ξ 4, Brut. 128). Cic.‚ as a member os the optimate
party, frequently laments the sate of Opimius (or. p. Sest. § 140), but
undeservedly, sor he and his party abused their victory most savagely.
According to Mommsen he was the true model of a Roman aristocrat.
