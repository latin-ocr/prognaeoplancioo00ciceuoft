(b) lee desmdant Gnaeus Plancius

§4 Cn. Plancius came of a plebeian family of eques-
trian rank28, and was born at Atinam, an ancient city in the
Sabine hills not far east of Arpinum, which was first a prae-

his life he incurred the displeasure of the optimate party
because of his vehemence in demanding an abatement of the
terins of a contract concluded unreservedly by a company of
publicani in Asia sor the farming of the provincial imposts.

bility of collecting the taxes from the already oppressed provin-
cials. C. Julius Caesar supported their prayer, while M. Cato,
who thought that they ought to be kept to the bargain which
they had made in their excessive eagerness‚ exerted himself to the
utmost against them and by his speeches so protracted the
session that there was no time for a division. And so the
matter was postponed‚ and perhaps might not have been
