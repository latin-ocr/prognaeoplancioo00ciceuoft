by their μέν,’ not always however as in one remarkable instance,
which he quotes, S. Paul Rom. VI 17 χάρις δὲ τῷ θεῷ ὅτι δουλοι ἦτε

scholiast wrote, as is probable, Servius Sulpicius, he may allude to
what Cic. says of Sulpicius and the editicii iudices or ‘special jury'
in or. p. Mur. c. 23 ἓ 46 ff, where he is referring to some lex which

tribuni aerarii, nominated by the accuser srom the register (album
iudicum), 75 of whom might be rejected by the reus, leaving 503 also
25 senators were to be appointed, but by some other means, none ot
whom could be rejected, so that the jury would consist in all of 75.
Even this law, says Cic.‚ was resisted. See Introd. ἓ 17.

had managed that harsh form of trial according to the vote of the

which the accused belonged and those which he cultivated—so far from
complaining, I should rather look upon him as virtually acquitted‚ by

the npmination of iudices to try his case, who might also be witnesses
