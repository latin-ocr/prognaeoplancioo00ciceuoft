xl INTRODUCTJON

§28. In the period between the lex Cornelia of 13.C. 81,
when the iudicia were confined exclusively to the Senate‚ and the
lex Aurelia of B.C. 70 we hear also of decuriae iudicum ¹4⁶. We
do not know sor certain upon what principle this arrangement
was founded, but it has been conjectured that the whole body of
iudices was then divided into sections called decuriae, possibly
ten in number, each having from 33 to 40 members‚ and that
the decuriae were called upon to serve in turn or that particular
decuriae were assigned to particular courtsffl. The list of iudices
varied from year to year, and each decuria, after the exclusion
of those who were legally disqualified, was further reduced by
lot to 15, which number constituted a collegium iudicum. If
there were any vacancies to be supplied in the consilium, caused
by the challenger, they were filled up by a process technically
termed subsorfftzo, because the presiding judge drew fresh names
from the urn. The same regulations seem to have applied
aster the passing of the lex Aurelia to the other two bodies
admitted by it, viZ. the equites and the aerarii tribuni. Each
of these orders also was divided into ten decuriae of 33—40,
the series from 1—10 was determined by lot, and the appoint-
ment of the decuriae composed of the three estates to try
the several lawsuits was made by the Praetor Urbanus. Thus
about 120 iudices, including those excused from serving, were

to try any particular cause.
