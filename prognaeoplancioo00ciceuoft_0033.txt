JNTRODUCTJON

relating to electioris under certain conditions‚ viz. to establish
confusio siff-agz‘orumfflss or ‘mass-voting,' as a means of pre-
venting bribery, whenever a fresh election took place in con-
sequence of an elected magistrate having been convicted of
ambitus. Sulpicius also proposed a change in the method of
judicial procedure: we hear now sor the first time of indices
editicii to try cases of bribery, his proposal being that there
should be 125 jurors noniinated (editi) by the accuser out of
the decuriae of equites and aerarii tribuni, of which the
defendant might challenge (reicere) 75, leaving 50, so that there
should be a jury of 75 in all, including 25 senators who were
to be appointed in some other way107. These proposals, how-
ever, of Sulpicius were not carried 3 but the bill proposed by
Cicero (lex Tullia de ambitu), occasioned by the electoral
corruption of the preceding year, was more successful. It was
supplementary to the lex Acilia Caffinrniawss, defining the
prooss of guilt more closely and adding to penalties,fixed by it,
in the case of senatorial candidates ten years exile. It also
sorbade certain practices tending to influence the electors un-
duly even when money was not offered, such as the presence of
crowds of hired attendants (deductores and sectatores). It
seems also to have imposed penalties on the dz'vzkoreslw. It
also forbade ‘treating,’ as no person was allowed to exhibit
gladiatorial shows or give public payments within two years
before he was a candidate, except under the peculiar circum-
stances of its being required by a testamentary disposition102.

1⁰⁶ ‘Servius proposed that the
votes should not be given by tribus
or centuriae in the usual way, but
that a majority of all the votes
should decide. This measure would
have helped very much to check
bribery, for as each centuria had
a vote, which vote was determined
by a majority in the centuria, it
was much easier to secure a ma-
jority by bribery and other ways
in a small number of electors than

to deal with the whole body of
electors.’ Long. On the other
hand, by the adoption of such a
measure, property would lose its
legitimate influence in the Comitia
Centuriam and the Comitia T ri-
buta would be at the mercy os
the urban tribes.
