et erat quaedam earum res publica neque tamen magistratus suos habe-
bant, in quas legibus praefecti mittebantur quotannis qui ius dicerent.'
Ramsay R. Ant. p. 92 ff.—Atinat1] Atina was situated in the far SE.
of Latium in the Sabine Hills between Venafrum and Sora. It was a
very ancient and powersul city3 hence Martial in an epigram on Marius
one of its inhabitants (Atinas) says Mari, quietae cultor cl comcs vitae,
quo cive prisca gloriatur Alina and Vergil Aen. vlt 630 calls it
Alina potens. Silius Italicus (VIII 398 monle nivoso descendens
Alina) speaks of its cold and elevated position, a senune which the
modern city of Atina retains. Though originally reduced to the con-
dition of a praesectum, it became subsequently a municz'pl'nm cum
suſji‘agio, and continued to be a considerable place under the Roman
empire. It was included in the tribus Teretina. Smith Dict. Geogr.

1.19. non tam suburbana] ‘not situated so near the city.' Tus-
culum was only abont 12 miles from Rome.

1. 20. quantum interesse vis] ‘how much diflerence wnl you nave

1. 21. utrum magis favere putas-suis ‘.’] ait Tusculanos minus
esse suffragatos municipibus suis, velut iampridem huiusmodi dignitate
saturatos; istos vero, qui Atinate oppido venirent, exoptasse ornari
Plancium, quod ea res non minus etiam ad honorem suum pertineret,
cum paucissimos de suis civibus haberent senatoriis magistratibus hono-
ratos. Praeterea et hine istis civitatibus adicit differentiam, quod
Atinates semper civibus suis saverant; Tusculani plurimum livoris
naturaliter etiam circa municipes suos habuisse videntur. Sic et M. Cato
ille censorius pro maligno et invido habitus est. Nec aliter etiam
Lucilius de eorundem moribus sentit hoc dicens: prima Papiria tu
solidarum. SCHOL. VATICANA, where for the last two words XVunder
suggests Dcscolz‘darum.

dispose the judges in his friend’s favour, ᾖ ²9·

= 1. 26. sellam curulem] by synecdoche sor ‘ honorem curulem,’ ‘a
curule office’ or ‘dignity.' The sella curulis was a folding-stool with
curved legs placed cross-wise, introduced from Etruria. The use of the
sella curulis, originally the exclusive privilege of kings, was afterwards
conferred upon consuls, praetors, curule aediles, also upon the dictator
and his magister equitum, the decemviri; and at a later period it was
extended to the quaestor. These high offices of state were hence calle-i
magistratus curules. The sella was of ivory or inlaid with ivory ;
hence Horace Epist. 1 6, 58 speaks of curule ebur for curulis sella.
