In 181 B.C. the lex Cornelia Boebiaffl was passed, and in Rc,
159 in the consulship of Cn. Cornelius Dolabella and M. Ful-
vius Nobilior another lex de ambilu,· it is impossible to say
whether the lex Cornelia Boebia or the lex Cornelia Fulvia is
designated in the Scholia Bobl'eusicz p. 351 Or. as the lex Cornelia,
where it is said a’aezmnalc' lege Cornelia lzoc genus poenae
serebant ut mqgrzssctmtzmm petitione per decem annos abstine-
rent. The same Scholiast adds to the above words, in relation
to a law passed at the desire of the senate in the consulship of
C.· Calpurnius Piso and Μ’ Acilius Glabrio B.C. 67 2—Alz'quam‘0
postea severior lex Calpurnia et pecunia mallavit et in per-
petuam honoribus iussit carere damnatos, habebant tamnen licen-
ίιάηι Romae morandi, with which Ascon. in Cornel. p. 68, 19⁰3
partially agrees. Besides the heavy penalties inflicted on the
candidates themselves, it is probable that a fine was also in-
ssicted on the agents and in particular on the divisores, and that
rewards were promised to those who had been condemned
for ambitus, if they procured the conviction of another on
the same charge. This lex Α elia Calpurnia was repeated with
some additional rigour as to its penal clauses in the lex Tullia
de ambitu, which was passed in Cicero⁷s consulate B. C. 63, and
the purport of which is given in the Scholia99, and in Dio Cas-

97 Liv. xx. 19, 11.
