ἓὲε- 35. First Part of the speech

*The case is straightforward enough but I am placed in an awkward
dilemma, if 1 adoptb the line of defence which the opposite side expect,
because I have not only to speak against an old and valued friend but,
what is more unpleasant, to institute a comparison between him and my
client in respect to personal mei-its, seeing that Laterensis insists upon
my showing what stronger claim Plancius had to the aedileship than
himself, and so 1 must either admit the superiority of Laterensis⁷ claim
to the injury of my client, or else wound his susceptibilities (§§3 · 6‚).
But it ought not to have been made a question of personal merit, sor
(1), even supposing Plancius to have been the less eligible candidate, it
must be remembered that the choice of the electors does not always
sall upon the worthiest candidate, the people are more osten iufluenced
