Q. Caec. ἓ 24), and he held this position until B.C. 70 when he appeared
iu defenee of Verres against Cicero (Quintil. 1 10, ²3)- The result of
this great contest was to dethrone Hortensius and establish Cicero as
the first orator and advocate of his day. In 13.C. 63 he pleaded with
Cicero sor Rabirius, who was indicted for the murder of Gaius Saturni-
nus (Cic. or. p. Rab. c. 6): and in the same year also sor L. Murena
when accused of bribery, and iu the next year for P. Sulla (Cic. or. p.
Sulla ἓ 12, ξπ) accused as an accomplice of Catiline: on all which
occasions he allowed his rival to speak last (perorare), which was tan-
tamount to an admission of his superiority. In 13.c. 60, on the coalition
of Pompeius with Caesar and Crassus, Hortensius, a staunch sup-
porter of the optimate party, retired from political life and hencesorth
until his death nc. 50 confined himself to his duties of advocate. He
appeared professionally with Cic. in desence of L. Valerius Flaccus,
charged with extortion in Asia (ep. ad Att. 11 τῇ, or. p. Flac. ἓ 41‚§ 54),
and in Rc. 56 of P. Sestius on a charge tle vi (or. p. Sest. ἓ 3, ἓ 14),
and in the following year of M. Aemilius Scaurus on a charge of
ambillis and 7'cssel1t12‹lae. He also defended Milo in B.C. 52. His last
speech was paulo ante mortem for Appius Claudius, who preceded Cic.
as governor of Cilicia, accused by Dolabella de maiestate et ambitu
(Brut. ξ 230, ἓ 3²4)· Hortensius began his course of civil honours
in B.C. 81, when he was quaestor, and was successively aedile B.C. 75,
praetor urbanus B.C. 72, and finally consul B.C. 69. Cic. gives us
a description of his eloquence in the Brutus c. 92—0. 96, whence
we learn that it was of the florid or ³ Asiatic’ type, fitted for hearing
rather than sor reading (dicebat melius quam scripsit Hortensius Orat.

have not* a single fragment left. See Ellendt eloq. rom. hist. ἓ 43
