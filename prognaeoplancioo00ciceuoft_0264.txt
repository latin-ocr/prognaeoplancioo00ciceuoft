C HAPTER XXXI

ἓ ¹75, 1. 7. clamitas] ‘you bawl out,’ ἓ 38 1. 4, a slur upon Lateren-
sis’ style of speaking, ct'. de or. 11 20 §S6, 111 21 §85 clamatores
odiosi et molesti, Brut. ἓ 182 ul intelllgi possit, quem existimem clama-
torem, quem oratorem.

quo usque ista dicis] reorum in te merita commemorando iudices
commovere studes, ut ea propter reos absolvant. w.

1. 8. nihil in Cispio profecisti] ‘you derived no advantage from talk-
ing in this wayin the case osCispius.' M. Cispius was tribune osthe plebs
in B-C. 57, the year of Cicero’s restoration from exile, when he took an
active part in Cicero’s favour, and on one occasion risked his life (or. p.
Sest. §76) sor him. In return sor these services he was defended by
Cic. when prosecuted sor amhilus, but convicted in spite of his advo-
cate’s eloquence and tears. Cf. or. p. red. in S.§ 21 quid M. Cispius?
cui ego Ipsi, parenti fratrique eius sentia quantum debeam: qni, cum a
me voluntas eorum in privato iudicio essct offivzsa, publici mei benqficii
memoria privatam ‹ffbnsionem oblz'llerarztnt, or. p. Sest. ἓ 76.

obsoletae] ‘worn out‚' ‘no longer of use.’

1. 9. quem—defendi] ‘whose desence I undertook by your persuasion,
just as it was from your testimony that 1 found out he had deserved so
well of me.’ On eodem cf. §54 l. 14, de off. 1 §63, §84‚ and see Kenn.
Gr. p.'285, Madv. Gr. §488.

1.1o. meritum] sc. esse.

1. 11. et ei. dices σοὶ] ‘and arn Ι the man whom you will address
with the taunt quo ταφῆς-Ι, whose exertions on Cispius' behalf were,
you say, unavailing ?' eizmihi tali and therefore contenderim not
contenderit is the correct reading.

1. 12. nam istius verbi cet.] “for the import of your invidious
remark ‘ how much longer' possibly might be this : ‘One man has been
given up to you ; another has been pardoned out of regard to you (spared
ior your sake); there is no end (to your begging off friends), we cannot
put up with it any longer. For when a man has exerted himself sor one
person in particular and has sailed to obtain the very object of his
exertions‚ to have said to him ‘How much longer?’ this looks more like
ridicule than rebuke.'' The syllogism is : ei dici potest ‘Quousque' qui
obtinuit. At ego non obtinui. Mihi igitur dici non potest ‘Quousquc.’
But, as Long observes, Laterensis did not mean this. He meant to say:
⁴ How long will you continue this kind of desence, when you see that it
does no good to your clients ?'' The SCHOL. AMBROS. have the follow-
ing note: ‘—unde quo miuus impudens videretur haec compensativa
defensio, dicente Laterense, quousque vis servatos esse quos di-
ligis? et pro Cispio eausam dicente sic rogasti et pre-
cibus tuis ambitum paene movisti, opposuit acutissimam re-
sponsionem merito haee ab eo dici potuisse, si pro illo impetrasset.
