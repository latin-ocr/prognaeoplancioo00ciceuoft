nominated as liable to sit upon a particular quaestio, and this
number was reduced by ballot (sorti'tto) and by 7e2''‚ectzo i. e. the
challenging ofthem permitted to each of the contending Grparties,
to an aggregate of 75 at most or 25 out of each estate.

The voting of the iudices was originally open, but after the
passing of the bill of L. Cassius Longius Rauilla (lex
Cassia tabellarz'a148) in Rc. 137 it was conducted in secret by
ballot (per tabellas), each juror depositing his tabella in one of
three boxes (sitella) according to the estate to which he belonged
in pul-suance of the lex Fufia 2·ud2·c2'ar2'a1⁴⁹. It was necessary
that at least two-thirds of the indices should be present and
vote.

ξτες. Besides these enactments the bill of P. Vatinius
(lex Vatinia de alternis consiliz's reiciendzk) was still valid in
Β, C. 54, by which according to Ernesti and othe'rs the accused
(rens) in a trial could challenge (reicere) all the iudices and con-
sz‘lz‘a once aud the prosecutor (accusator) could do the same—the
previous practice having been that each party, prosecutor and
defendant, could only challenge a certain number of the con-
silium, the places of those who were challenged being supplied
by the praetor⁷s subsortitio. But C. T. Zumpt supposes that
this law allowed either party to challenge the consilia once and
that on this being done a new consilinm was appointed: but
that it did not allow the whole consillum to be challenged
twice, as Ernesti supposed, first by the accused and then by the
prosecutor.
