Cicero repels the oljection of Laterensis, that all his eloquence and
emotional display were imffi’ctual and una?'ailingrfirrmerlr in his disc-nce
af another client Cispius, as mean, inconsistent and unreasonable.
(ἓ ¹7⁵—§ 76.)

Laterensis asserted that l'lancius’ services ‹lm—ing his tribunale had
not equalled those of Racilius, who theressyre deserved greater gratiluzle
from Cicero. Cicero says in 7¹ele¹‚ that he wishes the Roman people had
not been prevented by the violence (ff some men from making Racilius a
proper return for his sewices to himself, with which he professes himself
well satisfied and that he had πο need of Plancius’ further aid alter
he haa' already saved his life. signin, how could he help showing his
gratitude to one whom the senate had especiallv thanked on his behalf?
There is nothing he would not have done sor Laterensis, is the occasion
haci cffred, but he has so many benefactors that he is puzzlcd how to
reconciie their conflicting claims to his gratitudo. andstars he can scarcely
show himself gratrful to all at the same lime. ln the present case,
horcrevcr, where the disparity is sogrcat, his duty is plain : Laterensis
had but little to gain hy succeeding, he merely longed to eſjizce his defeat
sor the aedileship, whereas l'lancius would lose evervthiiigr by conviction.
Laterensis cannot suppose that the court will be pmjudiced against C icero
ou the ground of his erring on the side of excess in this gratilude‚ sor if
gratitude be, as it is, the foundation of all virtues, then excess in it can
lte no reproach. As to Laterensis' expression that the jurors are not
persons likely to run the risk osa trial nor fond of litigation, it ought
not. says C icero, to have any wezght wilh the jurors to make them care
little about his gratitudo, as is it could only be shown to those who needed
his professional services. (ἓ ⁷¹7—§ 82.)

Cicero replies, partly in jest, partly in earnm, to three tristing irn-
putations cys Laterensis, (ι) that he is too fond of making pathetic
appeals to the jury, (ι’) of appearing as coztnsel in defi'nce, (3) ‹ffsaying
smart things and making poor J'olees. (ξ 83-85.)

Cicero vindicates his hasty departure from Rome against the insinu-
ations of Laterensis. lt was not the sear of death which drove him into
exile, but the apprehension of civil war and cys the trouble which mig-ht
have befallen patriotic citizens had he remainea' in Jx'ome. He did not
,verz'slz to deprive the state of its mainstay nor the senate and people eff
the opportunity of setting an example of a zrgorous exercise cf power
and display ofgratitude by his restoration from exile. (ξ 86—§ 90.)

Laterensis taxes Cicero with having sbrseitea' his liberty of action,
Cicero denies that he has. No one can blame him, he says, if he has
regard sometimes sor his own safi’ty, when he has done so much sor the
safi’ty os others. If he no longer opposes his former enemies it does not
follow that he desei-ves to be twilted with political inconsistency. because
he accommodans himself to the changing circumstances and conditions os
society. The good qs the state is the standard by which every statesman
