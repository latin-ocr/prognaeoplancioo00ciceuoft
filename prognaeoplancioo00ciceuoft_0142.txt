CHAPTER V

The grounds upon which Plancius was chosen rather than Laterensis
put into the mouth of the public. Laterensis had been too remiss in
1115 canmss, relying on the pride os his birth: but he is not the only
instance of men of high family pretensions haxing been defeated in a
popular electiori by men of mean extractim and even of inferior ability.
Moieover he 116111 as quaestor to Cy·‚1ene thus keeping axx ay from
Rome when his services were much needed: and gave up 1115 canvass
sor the tribunate os the plebs at a great politica} crisis, which raised
doubts as to 1115 public spirit or capacity. If 116 wishes to serve the
state. he may still be aedile, even is he take no pains about his canvass.
but is he aspires as 116 ought 10 do to the higher state offices‚ he must
take more trouble than he has* hitherto done to obtain the popular vote
by ingratiating himself with his electors (§§ 12—14).
