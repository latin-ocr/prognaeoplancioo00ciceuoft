and we find mention in Livy 12⁵ of a cellcgy'mn ad ludos Capitoli-
nos faciendos ex eis qm· in Capitolio alque arce habitabant and
even of a collegium of Cornelii as existing in Β. C. 65, when
Cicero delivered his speech for Corneliusr'ss, which suggests
the idea of a league formed to support a political party. The
members of these collegia were likewise called sodales, at all

common sacra and their own statutes. The foundation of such
corporations may be traced back to the period anterior to the

unions occupying the public places of Rome in times of great
excitement and threatening disturbance of socia] order3 hence
in B. C. 68120 a decree of the senate was passed limiting the right
