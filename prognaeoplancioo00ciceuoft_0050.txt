Clustumina and fllarcia, the last, in the expectation that it
would be rejected by the accused, which proved to be the case.
A decuria of senators was joined by as many equites and tribuni
aerarii. This would give, if none were exeused or disqualified, ‘
from 90 to 108 iudices editicii. The number might be reduced
to 75, i. e. 25 out of each order, by challenges. Thus P. Vatinius,
who was impeached under the lexLz'cim‘cz before Cn. Plancius
was, had leave to challenge five jurors. In the ease of Cn.
Plancius none were allowed to be set aside‚ perhaps because the
minimum number allowed by law had been already obtained.

of cases of sodalicio, the indictment according to the lex Licinia
might be laid before any praetor. It is possible that the parties
might agree among themselves as to the choice of a president,
as was permitted by the lex [sasima. For it is questionable
whether otherwise Gaius Alfius Flavus, whom Cicero praises
so highly, would have been the iudex quaestionis in the trial of
Plancius, and that by the choice of Laterensis who was only
too ready to seize upon anything that would tell against his op-

friend of Cicero'sl⁵⁵‚ who was president of the quaestio de
maiestate in this year15⁰ and had shown himself gravis elfirmus
as a judge in the trial of A. Gabinius, and that against Gaius
Messius, who had been tried before another praetor P. Ser-
vilius Isauricusl'57, whom we know to have been president ofa
special quaestio.

ξ 33. The penalty sor a breach of the lex Licinia was the
same as that imposed sor acts of violence (vis). In the case of
Cn. Plancius it was a question of salus, patrz‘a,forlmme¹⁵8‚ i.e.
of perpetual banishment and of a fine proportioned in the litis
