ᾧ 16. The oldest laws relating to ambitus do not apply to
lmgilio. Thus the earliest enactment‚ of which we have men-
tion (B.C. 432), simply forbade persons to add white to their

Clodius that, when acting as se-
quester, he killed the dcvisores,
who were staying in his house,
in order to appropriate the money
held in trust from them: divi-
