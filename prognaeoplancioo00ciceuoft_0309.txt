APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXT 205

of the first council of Chalcedon), which Angelo Mai discovered had
been made up from ancient Mss of Symmachus' spceches, M. C.
Fronto, Plinii Panegyricus and fragments of the four lost
speeches of Cicero in Clodium et Curionem, de acre alieno Milonis, de
rege Alexandrino, together with an old and valuable Commentary on
these and on the four extant speeches pro A rchia, pro Sulla, pro Plancio
and in Vatinium. But a further discovery awaited him, sor upon his
return to Rome he detected in the Vatican a palimpsest, which evidently
formed the first part of that very MS of which the Ambrosian library
contained the second, ending in the speech pro Plancio with the word
adversus ch. IX ἓ 22, while the Milan MS begins with the word Tuscula-
nos (see notes p. 73). The MS was judged by Mai to be of the fourth
or fifth century. Part of these Scholia Bobiensia, as he called
them, was published by him at Milan in 1814 and the complete MS
in 1817. The commentary is imperfeet1 and, so far as this speech is
concerned, the text of some passages only of it is quoted for illustration
and explanation. There is no doubt that the Ambrosian palimpsest is
not only older than any known MSS, but derived from a better and more
trustworthy original.

[This edition contains the whole of the excellent commentar-y of Garatoni re-
printed from the ninth volume of his edition of Cicero's works, Naples, 1786, and
from his Curae secundae published aster a collation by J. C. Harless of the valuable
Tegernsee MS. It fully deserves the praises which the eminent Dutch scholar J. Bake
bestows upon it in his review in the Bibliotheca Critica Nova Tom. 111. p. 57—p.
88, where hc writes :—‘ Garatonii rationem interpretandi satis praedicare non possum:
adeo nihil est quod in eo desideres, Latinitatis scientiam cum universam, tum prae-
sertim consuetudinis Ciceronianae, historiae et antiquitatis diligentem investigatio-
nem, iudicium acerrimum et insignem disputandi prudentiam, quae hona commendat
lnsuper sermoqliatinus elegantior quam quo multi hisce temporibus Ciceronis inter-
pretes utuntur .
