jury (indices) so constituted for other actions: Sulpicius had
proposed that there should be for those of ambitus, but it
had been decided against him in 13.C. 63.

At the time of the trial of Plancius in Β. C. 54 the arrange-
ment introduced by the lex Aurelia of Lucius Aurelius Cotta in
B. C. 70 was in force, according to which the juries were to con-
sist of three decuriae, taken in equal numbers from the three
orders, the senators, the equites and the tribuni aerariz'lffl.
Up to the year Β. C. 123 the iudices, whether single jurymen
or a number of jurymen empanelled to serve either on the
standing or special commissions (quaestiones perpetuae or
extraordc'nariae), were taken exclusively from the Senate. In
that year the lex Sempronia iudiciaria of Gaius Gracchus
was passed which transferred the indicia, i.e. the right of
acting as jurors on criminal trials, from the Senate to those
possessed of the censns equester, who thenceforward constituted
the ordo equester144. The indicia remained in their hands for
forty-two years, until Sulla in Β. C. 81 gave them back to the
senate. But the reaction consequent upon the death of the
Dictator rendered the continuance of this arrangement im-
possible, accordingly in Β. C. 70 the law of L. Aurelius Cotta,
one of the praetors of that year, was passed, which ordained
that the izm'tees should be selected from the three orders, each
order forming a decuria. As the quaestiones papalem gradu-
ally came to embrace all criminal causes, a certain number of
iudices were selected by the Praetor Urbanus for the whole
and distributed among the different quaestiones The list for
the year was termed album indicum, and the jurors were
technically designated indices selectim. They amountcd in
all from about 3 ><350= 1050 to 3 ><4oo=1200.
