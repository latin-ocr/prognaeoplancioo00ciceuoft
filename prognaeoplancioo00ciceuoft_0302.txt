nomz'ne sum Dyrrhachi (ab Thessalonica) hoc tempore (Nov. goth),
¹at quam celerrume quid agatur audiam ,¹ et sum tuto: civitas enim haec
semper a me defmsa est. On his former visit he had not thought of going
to Thessalonica, but to Cyzicus (per Macedoniam Cyzicum petebamus ib.
4 ἓ 3, nobis iter est in Asiam, maxime Cyzicum ep. ad Att. 111 4, dated
April 19th‚ the very day of his arrival at Brundisium), his object being
to get as far as possible from Rome.

ἓ 98, 1. 4. refertam—sceleratissimomm hominum] For the
genitive after refertam cs. or. de imp. Cu. Pomp. ἓ 31 referto prae-
donum mari, or. p. Font. ξ 11 referta Gallia negotiatorum est,
and see Madvig Gr. ἓ 268 a obs. 1, Roby Gr. 11 ἓ 1336. These were
the relt'qm'ae of the conspirators who had ssed and dispersed themselves
through ‚Greece because of Cicero’s proceedings.

1. 7. cum tamen—viam] ‘since they were only several days’journey
off ⁷ and therefore might easily hear of his arrival.

1. 11. aliquando] ‘at sometime though not so soon as I might,’ ‘at
length aud high time too‚' ἓ 17 1. 26, ἓ 33 l. 4, ἕ 361. 12, § 471. 11. On

1.15. lictoribus dimissis] the quaestors were allowed lictors in the
provinces, but not at Rome, as we learn from A. Gellius N. A. X111c. 2.

insignibus abiectis] because his visit to Cicero was not an official
one.

§89‚1. 19. rem—crudelem—nefariam] sc. non per se, sed ob
causam. ERNEST1

1. 21. quaestorium] sc. aedificium, ‘the quaestor's official resi-
‹lence.’ It is used of ‘the quaestor's tent’ in the camp by Liv. x 33, 9.
The official residence of the governor of the province (which was always
called praetorium, whatever his title) was closed to him, because
L. Apuleius Saturninus, the propraetor of Macedonia in B.C. 58 (§§ 19,
