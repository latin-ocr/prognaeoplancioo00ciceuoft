ancient institutions at Rome. It was customary for members
of such brotherhoods not to sue one another at law, but rather
to contribute to each other's defence3 it was held mean and
dishonourable not to share in expenses for their mutual sup-
portUS: even sons had a claim on their father’s sodales¹¹⁹ sor
protection, and sometimes outsiders incurred the obligation of
a whole sodalitas by their support of a single sodall'5120. Thus it
was but natural that candidates for state offices should be upheld
by members of their own sodalitas, who did not scruple to use
any means, lawful or unlawful, of furthering and carrying
their politica} ends. It is easy to see how, under the guidunce
os {actious men‚these brother-hoods might be used for the pur-
poses of bribery or as centres of agitation and organisation of
political plots3 the different sodales might work on different
tribes and divide their adherents into decuriae, the better to
keep an eye upon them and command their services. Thus
their proceedings might in some cases become dangerous to

¹²¹ Hence the passages where
Cicero mentions sodales, whose
raison d'itre was being members of
a sodalitas, are either in speeches
delivered before Rc. 56 (as or. p.
Sull. ξ 7, or. in Verr. 11 §93) or
in wrirings where the usages os
an earlier period are spoken es
