would not be able or willing to contribute anything to main-
tain their clubs (like the old legitimate guilds which derived
their sunds probably from the contributions of the members),
but would expect to be paid for their services by those who
used them for their own purpose&

Thus sodalitates were brotherhoods instituted sor the purpose
of feasting and sacrifice, belonging to the same temple-worship:
collegia were associations whether of experts for maintaining
more surely and easily the traditions of their calling, or of the
lower ranks cf the population with a settled organisation for
guarding and propagating their politica] opinions. As the first
