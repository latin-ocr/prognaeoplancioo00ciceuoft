he exhibited games at Praeneste-⁵³, and afterwards served a<
proquaestor in Cyrene. In ΗΟ. 59 he became a candidate for
the tribuneship‚ but withdrew from his candidateship‚ amid the
applause of the conservative party, because he refused in his
candidatorial speech (oratio in loga candida) 5⁷ to bind himself
by an oath prescribed to all magistrates to observe Caesar's
law58 respecting the distribution of the public land in Campania.
He was denounced by L. Vettius in B. C. 59 as an accessory and
privy to a conspiracy against Gnaeus Pompeiusffl, and he ac-
quired thereby the character of a man dies alque noctes de laude
et de republica cogitans. When Cicero went into exile in
B. C. 58, Laterensis felt a warm sympathy for him⁶0 and showed

the optimate party. His partisanship made him unpopular and
his democratic adversaries watched their opportunity to raise
suspicion against him. In his dissatisfaction at the course of
events he withdrew from public life and was consequently for-

Crassus, he became a candidate for the curule aedileship‚he could
not fail to perceive that he had little or no chance of successffl.
Plancius wished for him as a colleague,until he saw that his own
prospects might possibly be injured by his support of Laterensis
It was not until the year 51 B.C. that he recovered lost ground
and obtained sufficient popularity to be elected praetorffl.

He appears once more in history as a legatus in the
army of M. Aemilius Lepidus, governor of the provinces of
Hispania citerior and Gallia Cisalpina in B.C. 43. &Vhen An-
tonius carne to Gaul after the battle of Mutina, Laterensis tried in
vain to confirm Lepidus in his allegiance to the senate3 and, as
soon as Lepidus threw open the gates of the camp to the victor,
