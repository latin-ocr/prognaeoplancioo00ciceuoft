1. 16. reprehensionis ansam anquam] ‘some handle sor censure.’

1. 17. Nicaeam] mod. Jslmik‚ the capital of Bithynia according to
Strabo XII p. 565, so named by Lysimachus (Plin. ep. X 40, 48). It
was here that in ΑΛ). 325 the celebrated council was held against the
Arian hemsy, in which the Nicene creed was drawn up.

severiorem] ‘more lnorally strict.’

1. 18. si spectanda causa est cet.] ‘the purpose of my being at
Rhodes, if we are to 1001< at our respective motives‚ was as honourable
to me, as yours was in being at Nicaea.’ Cic. was at Rhodes in B.C. 78
when he was 29 years old, after hc had made a tour of Asia Minor. and
visited the different schools of rhetoric, as that of Menippus os Stratonice,
Xenocles at Adramyttium, Aeschylus at Cnidos, Dionysius of Magnesia..
He remained a year at Rhodes studying under Molo and Posidonius (de
sin. 1 2). Ferratius remarks on this passage: ⁴ Oratorie, ut Laterensis
petitionem declinet, dissimulat quod ad suam in causis agendis prae-
stantiam pertinebat, dignitatis artem, quam profitebatur, tuetur.'

1. 20. nam quod] §541- 17, ἓ 68 l. 1.

quod-defenderem] ‘sor defending.’ After a leading proposition in
a past tense dependent interrogative and objective propositions are

the present or at all times (in which case the present is often used in
English), Madv. Gr. §383‚ Kenn. Gr. p. 483, above ἓ 37 l. 27. Orelli's
reading quod defenderim ‘sor having desendcd' would exclude the case of
Plancius.

§478, de am. ἓ 30 l. 5, ξ 73 l. 3 ed. Reid.

1. 22. fit vestra diligentia—ut cet] ‘it is the consequence of the
scrupulousness of men like you, who, while examining caresully the
briess presented to you, reject almost all, that most of them crowd to
me.’ There is an irony in the use of the word dilzgentia.

1. 23. causis ponderandis]=cum causas ponderatis et dissi-
cultatem earum agendarum perspicitis. W. Sometimes the
abl. of the gerund and gerundive denotes rather the way and manner
(‘while,' so that something takes place at the same time), Madv. Gr.
ἓ 416 obs. r, Kenn. Gr. p. 498, Zumpt Gr. ἓ 643, cf. my n. to Cic. de
