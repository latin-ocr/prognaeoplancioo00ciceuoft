1. 21. quaesitor] The criininal courts of Rome, aster their final
organisation by Sulla's lex Cornelia, were named quaestiones perpetuae,
⁵ standing commissions of enquiry.' The duty of the J u dge (quaesitor)
was to preside and to rcgulate the proeeedings in terms of the law
under which he acted. The duty of the jury (who as a body were
termed consilium, while the individua] members of the panel were
called iudices) waS, after hearing the pleadings and 1116 evidence, to
pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. The praetors
were 1116 ordinaiy presidents of these standing commissions, and
although their number was iucreascd from six to eight by Sulla,
criminal business increased so rapidly, that not only did the number of
quaestiones exceed the total number of praetors, but it was found neces-
sary to divide the administration of one quizeslio among several judges,
and subsequently to appoint supplementary ον assistant judges, who
were called indices quaestionis. See on this whole subject Ramsay’s
Introd. to the speech pro Cluentio pp. ,go—34, also Rom. Aut.
p. 288 ff. On the president of the quaestio cle sodaliciis see Intr. ἓ 32.
