1. 11. ld] sc. favere nobilitati.—ima.gin1bus] ‘It was the custorn
sor the sons or other lineat descendants of those who had held curule
magistracies to make figures with waxen faces representing their dig-
nified ancestors, and the right bestowed by such custom or usage was
called ius imaginum. These imagines or figures were usually ranged
in the public apartment (atrium) of the house occupied by the repre-
sentative of the family3 appropriate descriptive legends (tituli) were
attached to each; they were exhibited on all great family or gentile
festivals and solemnities; and the dignity of a family and of a gens
was, to a certam degree, estimated by the number which it could dis-
play· All persons who possessed one or more of these figures, Le. all
who could number among their ancestors individuals who had held oue
or more curule offices, were designated by the title of nobiles. Those
who had no figures of their ancestors but who had raised themselves to
a curule office were termed novi homines. All who had no figures of
their ancestors and had not, in their own persons, attaiued to a curule
office, were ranked together as ignobiles. Even after the admission of
the Plebeians to a full participation in political power, the higher offices
were, to a great extent, monopolisecl by a small number of families;
these nobiles became gradually more and more exclusive, and looked
,vith very jealous eyes upon every one not belonging to their own class
who sought to rise to eminence in the state. Hence the fierce oppo-
sition offered to Marius, who was a novus stoma, aud even Cicero, who
stood in the same position, was always, notwithstanding the services he
rendered to the aristocracy, regarded with coldness and aversion by a
large portion of the old nobiles. On the subject of Roman imagines
our great authority is Polybius vi 50.’ Ramsay Rom. Ant. p. 67.

would have voted sor you as aedile, surely we are not to blame if
those who like the ‘nobilitas’ form only a small party.
