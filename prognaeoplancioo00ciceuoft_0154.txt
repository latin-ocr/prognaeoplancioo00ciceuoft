CHAPTER VIII

§19‚ 1.15. municipio antiquissimo Tusculano] ‘The legend
which ascribes the foundation of Tusculum to Telegonus, the son of
Circe and Ulysses, is familiar to all readers of the Latin poets (factaque
Telegoni moenia celsa manu Ovid Fast. 111 91, Circaeo Tuscula dorso
moenia Sil. Ital. V11 692, Telegoni pulsatos ariete muros ib. XXI 535,

Telegoni iuga parricidae Hor. Od. 111 29. 8, Epod. Ι 30)....In the time
of the Latin league, from the sall of Alba to the battle of the lake
Regillus, Tusculum was the most prominent town in Latium. It
suffered, like the other towns in Latium, a complete eclipsc during the
later Republic and the Imperial tinies.' Burn Rome and tlze Campagna
p. 380 f. It became a mmzictfizlm cum stffvgio soon after B.C. 381
(Liv. Vi 26), before which time it had the civitas sine szqffiugio, and its
inhabitants (munin‘pcs) were enrolled in the Tribus Rzpiricz, Liv. v111

Tusculum was remarkable for the steacliness of its friendship sor
Rome, which was only interrupted in 13.C. 379, when in consequence
of a number of Tusculans being found amongst the prisoners in the
Volscian campaign, war was (leclared and Camillus sent against the
city. Cicero had a villa there (Tusculanum) from which his Tusculan
disputations take their name.

Max. 111 4 §6.—1uventia] according to the statement of L. Cassius
(ἓ 58), who united with M. Juventius Laterensis in accusing Cn. Plancius,
the first plebeian aedile was a member of this gens. Cicero denied the
correctness of the statement, but, true or not, the fact of its being made
is sufficient to prove the antiquity of the gens. The name does not
occur again in history till B-C. 194 when T. Juventius Thalna was made
praetor; and the first of the gens who obtained the consulship was
M. Juventius Thalna, who was the colleague of Tib. Sempronius
Gracchus B.c. 163 (Liv. XLIII 10, XLV 14). The family names of the
gens are Celsus, Laterensis, Pedo, Thalna. Sinith Dict. Biogr. 11
