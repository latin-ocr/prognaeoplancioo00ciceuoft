reproaches that he had not opposed force to force, even though
it should have eost him his life, and deplored the fatal step he
took in leaving Rome before he was directly impeached. His
letter addressed to Atticus (111 19) on the 16th of September
is a living testimony of the impatience and deep despondency
which had laid hold on him. When his enemy Piso entered
on his province of Macedonia, Thessalonica was no longer a

which the tribune P. Sestius nearly lost his life, and was
obliged to collect a force sor his defence. Milo attempted to
