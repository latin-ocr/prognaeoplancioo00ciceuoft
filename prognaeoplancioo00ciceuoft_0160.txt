72 PRO CN. PLANCIO [VIII §21—

1. 10. frequentior] ‘more populous,' cf. or. Phil. ΙΙ ἓ 10¹6 obviam
ei processit, ut est frequens municffiz'um, magna sane multitudo.
quam quidem nunc—vobis] Miscuit (a Greek word to be supplied) non
tantum quo doceretur iudex, verum etiam quo moveretur. adfectus
enirn coloravit ad misericordiam seeundum Plancium perrnovendam ex
habitu civium luctuoso, quasi ipsi sollicitudinem et modestiam (moles-
tiam, OR) pro suo cive susceperint. SCHOL. VATICz

1.11. 'm squalore et luctu] ‘in shabby apparel and mouming?
Both words refer to the external sign of grief, the former to the neglect
of dress and personal appearance, the latter to the action and gesture83
on the custom referred to see Ramsay‘s note on pro Cluent. ξ 18, and
cs. or. p. Mur. ξ 20, Verr. 11 5 ξ 128. or. pro Sest. ἓ 32 squalebat cz‘vt'-
las vesle mutata, ep. ad Att. ΙΙΙ 10 ἓ 2, or. p. red. ad Q. ξ 8.

1. 12.. tribuni aerarii] These consisted of respectable and well-to-
do people of the plebs, in earlier times charged with the raising of the
war-tax (tribulum) and the distribution os pay to the anny. By the lex
Aurelia B. C. 70 they formed a distinct ordo and shared the iudicia with
the senators and equites. This judicial office was taken from thern by
Julius Caesar, Sueton. Caes. e. 41 iudicia ad duo genera iudicum redegit,
equestris ordinis ac senatorii ,· tribunos aerarios, quoderat tertium,
sustulit. See Smith dict. ant. p. 26 b, Madvig opusc. acad. 11 pp. 258
—261, Halm ad Cic. Cat. IV ξ 15.

1. 13. nam plebem cet] ‘sor as to the rank and file of the munici-
pium, which were present to support him at his election, we have let
them go from the court of justice (dispensed with their attendance at
the trial).’ On this elliptical use of nam see note on de off. 11 ἓ 47, 111
ἓ 84. It indicates, not the reason of what precedes, but the reason why
what precedes did not include what is now added; I do not say the
plebs, {or &c. comitiis] sc. aediliciis, which took place just before
the trial of Plancius. qunder observes that the lex Iulia B.C. 90, by
which the civitas was given to the socii and Latini, conferred on the
inhabitants of the praefecturae the right ot' voting‚ which they had not
before possessed.

1. 14. roboris, through the number of the voters‚ dignitatis, through
their importance.

1. 15. tribum Teretinam] in which the burgesses of Atina voted.
Cic. means that their votes did not carry the tribe directly in favour of
Plancius, though indirectly they got him credit and importance‚ made
him the object of general gaze, lent him a compact, strong and inde—
fatigable body of supporters, and so influenced the voting of the tribe.
‘Monet hoc,’ says Wunder, ‘propterea, quod tribum istam a Plancio
corruptam esse Laterensis criminatus erat, de quo ἓ 38 loquitur.'

1. 16. oculorum coniectum praebuerunt] effecerunt, ut alii oculos
in Plancium conicerent eumque facilius suffragio suo iuvarent, quem
viderent tot ac tam splendidorum hominum gratia florere. WEISKE.
