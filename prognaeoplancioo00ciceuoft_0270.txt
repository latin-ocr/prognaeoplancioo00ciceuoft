172 PRO CN. PLANCIO [XXXII §79-

ἓ 79, 1. 27. mels ponderibus examinabo] ‘ 1 shall weigh them in
my own scale,’ lit. ‘ with my own weights.' Examinare is from examen
(ex, ago), ‘the tongue of a balance' (trutina), ‘the index of a steel·
yard,’ hence the phrase paribus examinatus ponderibus ‘in a state
of equilibrium‚’ Tusc. 1 ἓ 43. Cf. Verg. Aen. xil 725, Pers. Sat. 1 6
examenque improbum z'u illa castiges Ινιιίίηα, ‘correct the lying
tongue in that balance of theirs.’

1. 29. tempus] ‘ exigency‚' cf. ἓ 1 1. 5, ἓ 4 1. 27, ἓ 30'1. 30.

CHAPTER XXXIII

agitur studium tuum] ‘you are concerned about nothing more
than a triumph over Laterensis, or if you insist upon it—about some-
thing greater—your public reputation and the credit οἱ being an aedile z
Plancius on the other hand is in danger of losing his civil status, his
country, his fortune! By studium tuum is meant as Wunder expresses
it ‘ vehemens Laterensis cupiditas vincendi in soro eum, a quo in campo
victus est’ and by agitur studium tuum ‘expletur studium tuum, si
Planci caussam deserens ego tecum efficio ut condempnetur, aut non
expletur, si Planci causam agens efficio ut absolvatur! By agitur
existimatio tua is meant ‘amittis bonam de te famam, si absolvitur
Plancum, aut retines, si condempnatur!

1. 30. si vis] cs. de fin. 11 ἓ 14 hanc quoque iuczmditatem‚ -sz‘ vis,
transfer in animum, 11 ξ 89 in voluptate corporis (addam, si vis,
animi), de div. 11 ς’ 34 concedam hoc z'lfisum, si vis.

laus aedilitatis] according to Garatoni and Orelli this is an
appropriate expre—sion, because, if Plancius were convicted of bribery,
Laterensis would succeed to the aedileship. Wunder however objects

that there is no evidence to support such an opinion: he omits aedili-
tans.

1. 32. distineor et divellor] ‘I find myself in a painful state of
distraction,’ Germ. iclz hefindc mich z'n cinam sclzmerzlisleen Zwt‘cspalle,

ἓ 50 nec divelli mc distrahi.

1. 33. ln causa. dispari] ‘in a case os such disparity‚’ because
Plancius had cverything to lose by conviction‚ Laterensis nothing to
incur but the disappointment os his studium, cf. de off. 11 ἓ 61 l. 8.

me dius fidius] ἓ 9 1. ¹7·
