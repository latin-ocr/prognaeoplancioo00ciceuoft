1. 2. quasi qui omnia sciret] ‘ who pretended to know cverything‚’
but who did not know that Cicero had held the quaestorship of the
division of Lilybaeum and not that of Syracuse. The double quaestor-
ship in Sicily (Verr. 11 2 ἓ 11> is probably to be accounted sor by the
gradual acquisition of the island by the Romans, the western part
having been ceded by Carthage in 13.C. ‘24¹¹’ the eastern remaining
unconquered until B.c. 210. XVhen the entire island became a province,
a second quaestorship was founded because of its importanee as one
os the chief sources os their supply of corn, in the district of Syracuse,
that established over the district of Lilybaeum still remaining. See
Mr Heitland's note to Div. in Q. Caee. ἓ 2.
