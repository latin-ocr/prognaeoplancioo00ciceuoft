xlvi INTRODUCTJON

Cicero obtained his client's acquittal. But we have no ancient
authority sor this assertion. There is the evidence indeed of

Cicero himself in two letters addressed to him ¹0⁶ that he was
living at Corcyra, in B.C. 46 and it is assumed that he was, κ

living there in exile because of Caesar's emnity towards him as
a partisan of Cn. Pompeius3 but this is mere assumption, as
there is nothing to show why Cn. Plancius was living out of
Italy, whether in consequence of his conviction or sor other
reasons.
