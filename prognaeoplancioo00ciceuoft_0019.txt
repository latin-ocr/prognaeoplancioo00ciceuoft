INTRODUCTION xv

After this oration Cicero at the request of Cn. Pompeius de-
fended L. Cornelius Balbus, a native of Gades, on a charge
of exercising the Roman franchise illegally.

§3. The year 55 B.C. (=699 A.U. C.) opened with great
disturbance. The electioris still continued to be interrupted‚
so that it became necessary to appoint an Interrex, and it was
only at the conclusion of the first quarter that Cn. Pompeius
Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus, consuls each for the
second time, were able to enter upon the duties of their office.
While the tribune of the plebs Gaius Trebonius proposed his
bill to the popular assembly (lex Trebonia) that the consular
provinceS, Syria and the two Spains, should be held for five
years, and also that Caesar's administration of his province
should be prolonged for another five years, Cicero, yielding
passively to the stream of events, had retired to his Puteolan
villa24, where he commenced his three books de Oratore‘ssfg
and came back to Rome only to reply to the insulting speech
which Piso addressed to the senate in answer to the charges
Cicero had made against him. Crassus carried his lex de so-
dalz'cil'sw through and quitted Rome for his province Syria
before the expiration of his office and without providing for the
elections of the next year. An election of aediles for the year
B. C. 54, which should have taken place under his presidency,
had not been held27, and no other magistrates for that year
were chosen except the consuls L. Domitius Ahenobarbus and
Appius Claudius Pulcher, and even their election was deferred
till the close of the year B. C. 55. The aediles for the year B. C.
54 must therefore have been elected in that same year and per-
haps in the beginning of the second half of it, because Plancius
was accused before he entered on his office, certainly after
Ρ. Vatinius, whose trial did not take place until July. We may
conclude then that Plancius and Plotius were chosen in the
