118 PRO CN. PLANCIO [xx §49

CHAPTER XX

ἓξ 49--50, But the election af Plancius to the aedileship was
already a settled matter in the former year, when the Comitia were
attempted to be held. but for some reason postponat, when there was no
possibility of Plancius employing bribery ared corruption, even zf he had
thought af doing sa, because so short α notice was given by the presiding
qfficers af the electiori, and, as the vote of the centuria which votes first
determines the votes of those which come after, sa Plancz'us’ prior election
made his second electian sure. Though Laterensis, had he stoopea' to
make himself popular wilh the elector-s, might even then, in the interval
hslween the two elcctz'ons, have z'nfiuenced them to vntesor himself.

§49, 1. 28. sed cur sic ago? quasi cet] we might also punc-
tuate thus: secl cur sic ago qnasi cet. We have an instance of quasi
serving as a correlative to sic in de sen. ἓ 26 litteras Graecas—sic avide
arripui quasi diuturnam sitim explere cupiens ; where ita would be
more usually employed. ‘Nexus orationis hic est,' says XVunder,
‘conprobare Cicero c. XIX volebat, Plancium suffragia tribuum, quas
tulisset, non largitione devinxisse. Id nunc negat demonstrandum a
se >esse propterea quod priora comitia, in quibus Plancius aedilis sit
designatus, eo modo sint habita, ut nullo pacto tribus corrumpi potu-
erint.'

comitiis superioribus] ‘Intellegentia sunt ea, quae a. 699 Cn.
Pompeio 11 M. Licinio Crasso coss. haberi coepta, set propter obnun-
tiationem absoluta non sunt.' w. See Intr. ξ 3.

1. 30. consul] M. Licinius Crassus, the very man who had
carried the lex Licinia de sodaliciis (ξ 36), and who certainly would not
be likely to have connived at a breach of his own law at the election
over which he himself presided.

consul—summa auctoritate] abl. description or characteristic of
quality, Kenn. Gr. p. 399§ 153, Roby Gr. 11 1232.

1. 31. habere eoepit subito eelz] ‘he determined so suddenly and

1. 33. comparandi] ‘ for getting ready,’ as in Liv. xxxv 45, 5 ut
Romani tempus ad compara ndum habeant, XLII 52, 8 fallaci colloquio
extractam hiemem ut tempus ad comparandum haberent, Corn. Nep.
Thrasyb. 11 2 tempore ad comparandum dato.

Ρ. 20, 1. 1. diribitae tabellae] ‘the votes were sorted‚' ,8 ῐ4 l. 25.
The word tabellae is a conjectural addition of Wunder’s‚ adopted by
Baiter, Kayser, Hirschfelder. He objects to diribitae tribus in the
sense ‘the votes of the tribes were distributed.’ He proposes at the
same time to erase renuntiatae as a term inapplicable to tabellae and
because it disturbs the symmetry of the sentence. See ἓ 14 l. 26.
