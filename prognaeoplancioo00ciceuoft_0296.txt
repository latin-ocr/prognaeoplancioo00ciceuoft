CIIAPTER XXXIX

1. 7. Cn. Pompeium] of his relations to Pompeius Cic. speaks in
the or. p. Rab. Post. ἓ 33, and the motives which led him to attach
himself to his cause are explained in or. in Pis. ξ 76, and in the import-
ant epistle to Lentulus (ep. ad sam. 1 9). In the pro Sest. ἓ 74 he tells
us that Pompeius spoke in the senate in favour of his recall, and ἓ 107
that he showed himself non solnm auctorem meae salutis sed etiam
supplicem populo Romano. Again 01. 111 Ρ15. § 35 he states that it
was at Pompeius' suggestion that a senalus consultum was passed,
nt, sz' quis impedisset reditum meum, in hostium numero putaretur
and § 80 he says of him me omnibus studiz's suis, laboribus, vitae peri·-
culis complexus est. It was Pompeius also that brought about the re-
conciliation between him and Caesar ib. ξ, So.

1. 11. quem—concedunt] the indicative is used, because the rela-
tive clause is a simple definition oscum the person, Roby Gr. 11 ἓ 1681.

1. 12. C. caesaris] Omnis enim illa tempestas, cui cesserat Cicem,
Caesare impulsore atque adiutore dicebatur excitata, ita ut omnes
Ciceronem Caesari semper fore inimicissimum putarent. Itaque quod
mox in gratiam cum eo rediit, a multis obiectum Ciceroni est. Csr. or. (le
prov. cons. ξ 18 sqq.‚ c. 17 sqq.‚ or. p. C. Balbo c. xxvn ἓ 61, 01. in
Pis. 0. XXXII b 79, ep. ad fam. 1 9, 3. W.

desim] dubitative question, 78 l. 16, Kenn. Gr. p. 339, Roby
Gr. 11 1610, Madvig Gr. ξ 353, Zumpt Gr. ἓ 530.

quas—videam] the subjunctive is used because it assigns the cause
why Cicero cannot fall short in his duty to Caesar.

populi Romani] who by passing the lex Vatinia conferred on
Caesar the government of Gallia citerior together with Illyricum sor
five years: Suet. Caes. 0. ‘22 initio quidem Galliam Cisalpinam, Illyrico
adiecto, l ’ξε Vatinia accepit, · mox pez· senatum Comatam quoquc, verilis
patribus ne, si z'pn negassent, populus ct lianc dant. Caesar held these
provinces for five years with seven legions. In 1: C. ’7 the senate, upon
the motion of Cicero, decreed him snpplchalzoncm quindeci'm dietum
(quod ante id tempus accidzt nulli, as he says himself B. G. 11 35, 4), ste-
pendium εἰ decem legatas de prov. cons. ἐξ 26, 27, cf. or. p. Balb. ἓ 61.
111 B.C. 56 Cic. procured for him by his speech de provinciis consulari·
bus (Introd. ἓ 2) a prolongation os his command in Gaul sor five years.

1.13. cui me semper addim] ‘to whom Ι have devoted myself
at all times' ‘Callicle senatui nunc tribuit Caesar, certe a senatu 50
adsentiente ait sactum, quod senatus auctore Cicerone potissimum¹
