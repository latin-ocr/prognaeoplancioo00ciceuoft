suaded, have sure knowledge, that they are not ill-natured.’ On the
difference between certe scio (which is found in some MSS here) and certo
scio see Mr Reid's note on the Cat. mai. ἓ 21.18. On the allusion con-
tained in malevolos see note of the Scholia Bobiensia quoted above.
The same scholiast suggests that Cicero is here speaking ironically:
‘Hoc dicitur ab eo ἐν ῂθει; quippe cum diversum intellegi velit, simulat
contra Tusculanos verecundiam malevolentiae negatione.’

1. 31. de fratre meo] Q. Tullius Cicero, brother of the orator,
was born B.C. 102. He accompanied his elder brother to Athens
‚79 (de fin. V 1), where he stu( 1ed rhetoric with him. In 65 he
was Cplebeian aedile and in 63, the >ear of his brother's consulship,
he was designated as praetor sor the following year. From Β. C. 61 'to
Β. C. 59 he was propraetor of Asia (or. p Flacco ἓ 33 §49 ἐμ). On his
return to Rome m Β. C. 58, he exerted himself strenuously to procure the
recall of his brother from exile (or. p. Sest. ἓ 76, ep. ad Att. IV 3 ἓ 2).
In B.C. 57 he was made (erratus to Pompeius, when the latter had polcshzs

his brother's legate in Cilicia. In the civil war between Caesar and
Pompeius he joined the latter (ep. ad Att. 1x 1, 6), but aster the battle
of Pharsalia (13.C. 48) he quarrelled with his brother and made his peace
with Caesar. In ΒΟ. 43 he fell a victim to the proscription of the
triumvirs. Quintus was married to Atticus' sister Pomponia, but their
union was an unhappy one (ep. ad Art. V 1 &c.).
