Labicana] of Labici (Liv.11 39, JV 45) or Labicum (Colomuz), an
ancient city of Latium, at the north-east foot of the Alban hills, about
fifteen miles south-east of Rome, west of Praeneste and north-east of
Tusculum. It was a member of the Latin league, and as such retained
down to a late period the right of participating in the sacrifices on the
Alban Mount (Dionys. v 61). In common with Corbio and Gabii, it is
frequently mentioned as a place of great importance in the history of
the Aequian wars of the third and fourth centuries of the city (Liv. 11
39, Dionys. VII 19). A colony was sent to it about Β. C. 418 (Liv.
ΙΙΙ 25, 1V 45—-47, 49). Vergil places it by a prolepsis among the
towns allied to Latinus, Aen. vn 796 et Sacranae acies et psai scula
Labici. It is referred to again by Cic. or. de leg. agr. 11 ξ 96 in con-
junction with Fidenae and Collatia as a petty municipium in a poor
and decayed condition. See Burn's Rome and tlte Campagym p. 380 f.

1. 3. Gabina] of Gabii, which was another city of Latium, a
colony of Alba (Verg. Aen. VI 773l‚ situated midway between Rome
and Praeneste on the edge of the Lago di Pantano, in the districtos
Castiglione. It was one of the largest and most populous members of
