Catoni, homini (gualo et novo, quo omnes quasi exemplari ad indus-
triam virtulemque ducimur, ccrle licuit Tusculi se in otio delectare
salubri et propmquq loco). He passed the earlier years of his life z'n
parsimoma atque m ‹lurilia' atque waburna, ag ’⁶¹70 calendo, raris Sabz
nz's si'liczbus repaslz'nandzs alque commend& (Fest. p 281). He enteied
the army as a common (07 dinamus) soldier about the time of the battle
of lake Trasimenus, but subsequently served as military tribune under
Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius at the capture of Tarentum B.C. 209
(de sen. ξ 10), and under C. Claudius Nero at 'the battle of the Metau-
rus. In 13.C. 204, at the age of thirty, he began his political career
with the quaestorship‚ and served under Scipio Africanus in Sicily and
Africa, but their habits and views of lise differed so much that he was
allowed to return to Rome. In B-C. 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, in
B. C. 198 he was chosen praetor and obtained the province of Sardinia,
which he ruled with the strictest economy and justice. In B. C. 195 he
was elected consul with L. Valerius Flaccus, being the first novus homo
elected since C. Flaminius the consul of B-C. 217 carried on a suceess-
sul war in his province Hispania citerior and triumphed on his return.
XVhen the war against Antiochus broke out he served on the staff of the
consul Μ’. Acilius Glabrio as legatus consularis (Liv. XXXVI 17, 1) or,
according to Cic. de sen. ξ 10, as tribunus milz'lnm, and the decisive
victory of the battle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochuswas driven
out of Greece, was mainly owing to him. From this time his military
career ended; and for the next forty years he' was the leading figure on
the stage of Roman polines, distinguishing himself by his vehement
opposition to the Roman nobles, especially the Scipios. In Β. C. 184 he
was censor with his old friend Flaccus, but all his struggles against the
degeneracy and luxury of the times during his tenure of this office
proved unav ailing His life· long prejudice against Carthage is well
known, and how he alxiavs ended Dhis speech, whatever was the subject,
with ‘celerum censeo delendam esse Cczrl'lzagznem.' He died B.C. 149
before the conclusion of the war. Cato enriched the Latin language
with several literary works. His de re rustica is a miscellany of maxims
relating to domestic and rural economy: his ἀποφθέγματα (Cic. de off.
1§ 104, de orat. 11§ 271) is a collection of witty sayings from Greek
and Roman sources. We have also fragments of some of his speecheS,
the titles of ninety of which are still known. His greatest work, how-
ever, was the Orz'gz',ne5 the first historical work in Latin, many frag-
*men’ts of which are extant (g661. 16). His antipathy to the Greeks
and their literature showed itself' m various acts, as when he urged the
removal of the famous embassy from Athens m Β C. 153. There is a
splendid and celebrated portrait of him in Livy XXXIX 40. His bio-
graphers are Corneliusr Nepos, Plutarch and Aurelius Victor. Some

(fjcts also relating to him are found in Cicero’s Brutus and the treatise
e senectute.
