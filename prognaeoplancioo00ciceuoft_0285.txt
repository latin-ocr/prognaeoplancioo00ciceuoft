passage ‘ ἰδίως pro stomachi sui acerbitate Gabinium lacerat quasi samo-
sae inpudicitiae, quem minitatum proscriptionem equestri ordini ea-
propter dicit, quod illius edicto suisset L. Aelius eques Romanus, cui
familiaris amicitia cum M. Tullio suerat, relegatus.' L. Aelius Lamia,
a distinguished member of the equester ordo, was a zealous supportet of
Cicero in the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was con-
sequently marked out sor vengeance and banished (relegatus) sor a limited
time without capitis deminutio by the influence of the consuls Piso and

selected friends see the speech in Cat. 11 c. X where dancing and singing
are enumerated as some of the accomplishments of his pueri tam lepidi
