aestimatio to the amount of the sum expended in bribery. A re-
ward1⁵⁹ was decreed to the prosecutor, if he proved successful.
If it consisted of a money payment‚ the sum had to bear rela-
tion to the litis aestimatio. It might, however, consist of laus

Two other accusations had already been made in the year
B. C. 54 of a breach of the lex Licinia, one of Gaius Messius1⁰⁰
in July‚ another in August of P. Vatinius161 by the celebrated
orator Licinius Calvusm, before the impeachment of Cn. Plancius
which must have taken place at the end of August or beginning
of September. We hear of only two other accusations for the
same offence subsequently, one of T. Annius Milo by P.
Fulvius Neratus163 in Β. C. 53 and another of M. Valerius
Messala in B.C. 51154. In fact there is no mention made of
the law except in the period B. C. 54—51.

Under the emperors it dwindled to a statute for the punish-
ment of those who employed the assistance of hired bands in
canvassing for any municipal or priestly office. Offenders‚ like
those guilty of violence, were exiled to a distant island165.
